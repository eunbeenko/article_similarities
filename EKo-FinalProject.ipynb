       "['The Summer Olympics won’t arrive in Los Angeles for another nine years, but its local organizing committee will begin selling Olympic advertising as soon as 2021.  The organizing committee, L.A. 2028, and the Olympic television partner NBCUniversal are announcing a comprehensive partnership to sell advertising and sponsorships for all Olympic and Paralympic Games from 2021 through 2028.  Traditionally, advertisers interested in the Olympics have had to approach a number of different sellers. They went to NBC, which will televise the Olympics through 2032, to purchase television advertising before, during and after the Games. They went to the United States Olympic Committee to sponsor Team U.S.A. They went to the local organizing committee for marketing efforts at the Games themselves.  Now they will go to NBCUniversal, which will lead the partnership, for all of it, giving the International Olympic Committee’s largest media partner uncommon power over the marketing of the Olympics in the United States.        “What we are responding to here is not what the marketplace needs, but is demanding,” Casey Wasserman, chairman of L.A. 2028, said in an interview.  Linda Yaccarino, the chairman of advertising at NBCUniversal, said advertisers would be able to purchase the rights to intellectual property, product marketing and to opportunities to market their companies at the Games through the partnership, in addition to buying traditional television and digital streaming advertising.  L.A. 2028 and the U.S.O.C. had previously formed a joint venture to control United States-related Olympic and Paralympic sponsorship rights for the same time period, 2021 through 2028. According to Wasserman, L.A. 2028 has given the U.S.O.C. a $480 million guarantee for those rights. Details of how NBCUniversal, the U.S.O.C. and L.A. 2028 will divide revenues were not released.  The International Olympic Committee mandates local organizing committees reach a commercial agreement for the Games with their national Olympic committee to avoid confusion. But the I.O.C. doesn’t stipulate what that agreement looks like, and the one between L.A. 2028 and the U.S.O.C. is particularly long.  The eight-year joint venture is three years longer than the five-year partnership between the local organizing committee and the U.S.O.C. ahead of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The length is intentional, to facilitate selling to sponsors who want to be involved for more than one Olympics cycle.        “In the world of sports, long-term sponsor deals are the norm,” said Wasserman, pointing to television rights agreements and title sponsorships that extend for 10 or 20 years.  L.A. 2028 is targeting $2.5 billion in total sponsorship revenue for the Games, Wasserman said.  NBCUniversal made a “significant financial commitment” to L.A. 2028 as part of the agreement, but declined to reveal the amount.       ']"

       "['the summer olympics won’t arrive in los angeles for another nine years, but its local organizing committee will begin selling olympic advertising as soon as 2021.  the organizing committee, l.a. 2028, and the olympic television partner nbcuniversal are announcing a comprehensive partnership to sell advertising and sponsorships for all olympic and paralympic games from 2021 through 2028.  traditionally, advertisers interested in the olympics have had to approach a number of different sellers. they went to nbc, which will televise the olympics through 2032, to purchase television advertising before, during and after the games. they went to the united states olympic committee to sponsor team u.s.a. they went to the local organizing committee for marketing efforts at the games themselves.  now they will go to nbcuniversal, which will lead the partnership, for all of it, giving the international olympic committee’s largest media partner uncommon power over the marketing of the olympics in the united states.        “what we are responding to here is not what the marketplace needs, but is demanding,” casey wasserman, chairman of l.a. 2028, said in an interview.  linda yaccarino, the chairman of advertising at nbcuniversal, said advertisers would be able to purchase the rights to intellectual property, product marketing and to opportunities to market their companies at the games through the partnership, in addition to buying traditional television and digital streaming advertising.  l.a. 2028 and the u.s.o.c. had previously formed a joint venture to control united states-related olympic and paralympic sponsorship rights for the same time period, 2021 through 2028. according to wasserman, l.a. 2028 has given the u.s.o.c. a $480 million guarantee for those rights. details of how nbcuniversal, the u.s.o.c. and l.a. 2028 will divide revenues were not released.  the international olympic committee mandates local organizing committees reach a commercial agreement for the games with their national olympic committee to avoid confusion. but the i.o.c. doesn’t stipulate what that agreement looks like, and the one between l.a. 2028 and the u.s.o.c. is particularly long.  the eight-year joint venture is three years longer than the five-year partnership between the local organizing committee and the u.s.o.c. ahead of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta. the length is intentional, to facilitate selling to sponsors who want to be involved for more than one olympics cycle.        “in the world of sports, long-term sponsor deals are the norm,” said wasserman, pointing to television rights agreements and title sponsorships that extend for 10 or 20 years.  l.a. 2028 is targeting $2.5 billion in total sponsorship revenue for the games, wasserman said.  nbcuniversal made a “significant financial commitment” to l.a. 2028 as part of the agreement, but declined to reveal the amount.

       " 'calgary, alberta — hobbled by a reputation for gross expense and corruption, the international olympic committee has become a mendicant, shuffling from nation to nation, shaking its cup and asking if anyone might be interested in bidding on the 2026 winter games.  norway, the greatest of all winter olympic countries, found too many expenses and too much potential environmental damage. pass. in innsbruck, austria, which hosted the 1976 winter games, the burghers shook their heads and voted no. a canton in switzerland, home of the i.o.c., voted to bolt the door.  so olympic officials turned their eyes to calgary, the lively canadian city that hosted the 1988 winter games. they murmured softly and smiled sweetly and asked: might you like to bid?  calgary officials nodded, yes, they might like that indeed. and the i.o.c. officials, well-heeled princelings beneath their tattered robes, smiled so broad.        this is a city brimming with optimism. mayor naheed nenshi is a quick-witted urban wonk, and the city has a diverse and educated population. its most recent public work is a breathtakingly beautiful public library that arrived on time and under budget. hizzoner walked into a debate last week and a later interview with me intent on selling all on his vision ahead of a referendum tuesday on whether to submit a bid.  “the international olympic committee does worry me and keep me up a bit at night,” nenshi said. “but this is an outstanding deal for calgary.”  nenshi and his supporters propound canadian exceptionalism: we would stage these games as we do everything, which is to say on budget and without corruption or toleration of doping.  you are tempted to root even as you wince. so many optimistic cities and nations have walked this path only to tumble down the olympic stairs of inflated hopes, spiraling costs and corruptions’ bruises.            image     a cross-country skier at canmore, near calgary.   credit  todd korol for the new york times         quite a few in calgary share my skepticism. boosterish sorts admit to jumping nerves before tuesday’s referendum.        the city is mired in an oil and gas slump, and 25 percent of its downtown towers are vacant. a survey group hired by the city surveyed more than 7,000 people and found decidedly more with a negative view of the olympic bid. of late, a councilor who was allied with the mayor in pushing the olympics announced that he could no longer support a bid.  “there are too many unanswered questions and an incredible amount of risk,” the councilor, evan woolley, said at a public debate on the plebiscite.   [want more canadian coverage in your inbox? subscribe to our weekly    canada letter newsletter.   ]   no olympic games since 1968 has met its budget. vancouver went a modest 13 percent over (although its athletes’ village went belly up afterward at a cost of $100 million), while other cities had grand mal seizures. london and sochi  ran over by 76 percent and 280 percent.   when tokyo signed on for the 2020 summer games, officials sounded remarkably like those in calgary. they promised to deliver a frugal penny- and pound-wise olympics for about $7.3 billion.  then they adjusted estimates to $12 billion. of late,  the number has soared to $25 to $30 billion.   oops.  the salt lake city games in 2002 nearly drowned in a despond of corruption; the  pyeongchang games in february chewed up forests and pushed out villagers .        i attended the 2016 summer games in rio de janeiro and  wrote of the corruption and violence  that had fallen on the poorest in the beautiful city, and the schools and hospitals starved for funds as the government spent grandly on its olympic taj mahal.            image        snow makers covering canada olympic park in calgary with a blanket of new snow. presumably the real stuff would be available at a 2026 olympic winter games.   credit  todd korol for the new york times         rio’s mayor at the time, eduardo paes, wrote a letter complaining of my calumnies and took offense at talk of corruption. another year passed, and brazilian prosecutors found olympic corruption everywhere. an executive from a big construction firm testified that he had given $5 million in bribes to paes.  the former mayor denies those charges.   calgary hired ernst &amp; young to crunch its numbers. i sat in a council meeting as its sober gentlemen took us skipping through the numbers, all of which — miracle! — added up in favor of the bid.  i nosed about afterward on the internet and noticed that ernst &amp; young had served as a richly compensated “exclusive provider” to the rio olympics. previous olympic cities, ernst &amp; young noted in a news release, had seen arenas turn into white elephants. not rio, no no. “we have established sustainable postgame use for facilities” through a regimen of good governance and finance, the release said.  two years later, rio de janeiro is stuck with a rumbling herd of white elephants, olympic pools filled with rat feces, and a burned and collapsed velodrome and wrecked arenas. officials have scrapped promises to turn olympic handball courts into four public schools. as espn reported, the only one of the sports federations not found implicated in corruption was the brazilian confederation of sports for the visually impaired.  you can only hope that olympic and perhaps ernst &amp; young officials had some fitful nights of sleep.  the i.o.c. has grown edgy at the lack of suitors seeking to host games and proclaimed itself ready to shed the tux and don the hair shirt. it introduced a “games changer” called the  new norm , which encourages construction of fewer new stadiums and would share more dollars with host cities.        so calgary would, for the most part, refurbish facilities used in the 1988 olympics and focus construction on a much-desired new winter field house. the i.o.c.’s case is not vaporous, and city officials have debated it publicly.  a snow-capped wall of rockies rises to the city’s west, and the region is rich in winter sports, because of the legacy of hosting the 1988 games. to drive to canmore, a ski town that sits within the ice-blue shadow of those mountains and would host olympic events, is to find world-class winter athletes on nearly every block.  that said, calgary officials take a parochial, calgary-centric view of costs, the details of which were still being worked on in the days before the vote. mayor nenshi said calgary’s share would come in at a touch more than $400 million. the provincial alberta government would fork over $700 million, and the federal government in ottawa has promised a barrel of money, too.            image        the olympic flag flying with the flags of world countries at canada olympic park in calgary.   credit  todd korol for the new york times         “this is almost a tax rebate,” the mayor said.  this would be so if we assumed tax dollars not gathered in calgary fell from the sky like snow. alberta is hard-pressed by the same slump in oil revenue, and money spent renovating curling and skating rinks could mean less money to build and repair schools, roads and parks.  more broadly, calgary officials speak of the olympics as a defibrillator for local spirits grown gloomy. the games offer two weeks of free global advertising.  david finch, a professor specializing in marketing, participated in that recent debate and wove a splendid web. “we’ve got 30 years of data that shows they will come,” he said. “it is the equivalent of hosting 21 super bowls.”        this is debate as a p. t. barnum marketing seminar. i called brad humphreys, an economics professor at west virginia university who studies olympic finances. he acknowledged that the olympics make you feel good, and it’s a two-week advertisement.  the remainder is a busted model.  “there is a lot of temporary employment and no evidence of substantial economic impact,” humphreys said. “the very fact the i.o.c. is desperate to force cities to compete to host the games is to extract as much benefit as they can for themselves.”  mayor nenshi acknowledges the olympics are no economic silver bullet. but he is convinced calgary can game the gamers.  “i believe calgary can host the cleanest, most cost-effective games in history,” he said. “if that’s not what they want, we’ll say, ‘thank you.’”  as i listened, a tale from dim memory jumped to mind. decades back, my wife and i were newly married, and we wandered in a fine mood through manhattan and came upon a game of three-card monte. we are city natives and knew the game was a flytrap for naïve tourists. but we watched, and by god, after a while we had it figured out.  i raised my hand and put down a $20 bill.  the three-card-monte curator waved me in and smiled so sweetly and set to moving his cards a little faster and a little better. i guessed wrong. damn. we were church-mouse poor, and i needed that $20. so i put down another bill. my stupidity ended at 60 unaffordable dollars.  here’s my advice to calgary: keep an eye on those i.o.c. cardsharps. i guarantee the cards will end up moving faster than you guess.

       " \"penticton, british columbia — inside the living room of her new home, kikkan randall held a wig in her hands.  her own hair is growing back, but it is still a long way from matching the shoulder-length coiffure with the pink streaks that she sported for much of her career to remind her audience that cross-country skiers were “not boring.”  the  blond wig  with a pink streak — purchased last year in anchorage, her home city — was meant to    provide a sense of normalcy amid upheaval.  “it’s funny,” she said last week as she placed it on her no-longer bald head. “where we’re at now, i feel like i’m playing dress-up when i wear this.”        a year ago, when randall and jessie diggins  won the united states’ first olympic gold medal  in cross-country skiing and its first   medal of any kind in the sport in 42 years, randall already had breast cancer.  she just did not know it yet.  after all the wide-eyed jubilation in pyeongchang, south korea, on the night of feb. 21, 2018, randall’s realization that something might be wrong came on a much quieter evening — and served as a stark reminder that cancer doesn’t really care if you are an olympic medalist, an icon in your sport, have no family history of the disease and are more fit than 99.99 percent of the population.  it was may 13, mother’s day, less than three months after her crowning achievement. the newly retired randall; her husband, jeff ellis; and their 2-year-old son, breck, had just spent a day in the outdoors near their new home in penticton, a small canadian city that sits between two lakes in the okanagan valley.  they had hiked in the nearby mountains in the sunshine, bought a grill for their yard and shared the feeling that they were finally settling into a rhythm after months of transition and a post-olympic move from anchorage.  “we’d had the best day,” randall, 36, said. “i was so psyched on life, psyched to be a mom, psyched to be here starting our life here together. and then i was getting ready for bed and just happened to notice it.”        her fingers brushed across something hard in her right breast.  “i thought it was my rib bone at first, but then it was, ‘hmm, it feels like it’s kind of moving around in there,’” she said.  the diagnosis, delivered on may 31 by telephone as she was traveling to a wedding in sweden, was stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma.            image     kikkan randall's husband, jeff ellis, helping her put on a wig. randall received her cancer diagnosis about three months after she won an olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing.        “early on, there was definitely a heavy, why-me phase,” ellis said of randall’s reaction. “how is this possible? after all these years i finally got my medal and now i can’t enjoy it? so many years of delayed gratification. but kikkan is pretty indomitable, which means that you are not always up, but that’s the predominant spirit.”  randall and ellis have been uncommonly open throughout her treatment, particularly  on social media  — an attempt to connect with randall’s fan base and to provide others in similar situations with information and inspiration. she has posted from the wig shop, the hospital recovery room, the bathroom mirror and her penticton couch after chemotherapy and a cold caught from breck left her drained and miserable for a stretch last year.          randall found the two pea-size tumors in her breast relatively early and received an upbeat prognosis for a common type of cancer.         but as a new arrival in canada, she did not yet have health insurance. the united states olympic committee agreed to continue providing coverage throughout her extensive and expensive treatment, but she was required to receive her primary cancer care in the united states.  she chose anchorage, where her parents and many of her closest friends live and where she remains a local icon after competing in five olympics. but that meant weeks apart from jeff and breck as she shuttled between canada and alaska going through six rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, follow-up surgery and 33 sessions of radiation.  shortly before she finished her final radiation session, on jan. 25, her mother, deborah, opened a bottle of champagne to mark the occasion. the bottle had originally been purchased to celebrate randall’s long-awaited gold medal.  “when cancer happened, my mom decided that bottle had a new meaning,” randall said.            image        randall training in a room at home that contains an image of the olympic photo finish.         image        randall’s olympic gold medal for the women’s team sprint freestyle event in cross-country skiing.      image        randall lifting in her home gym.       there are, of course, private burdens, none heavier than the reality that randall’s treatment means she and ellis must postpone plans to have more children. that made her mother’s day discovery all the more poignant.  “when i found out i had cancer, it was almost disbelief,” randall said. “it was like, ‘i did everything right, and i’ve taken really good care of myself.’ i had put all this work in my career and was looking forward to a point where i would get the kind of time to not have to be so disciplined and enjoy the reward of all that effort. but what really has been the most upsetting is the fact we couldn’t try and have another kid right away.”        in her mid-30s , with a tight window before she needed to start chemotherapy in july, randall said she had enough time for one cycle of fertility drugs so the couple could try to have another child later. she and ellis worked with a clinic in seattle, which was unable to ship her some of the necessary medication because of import regulations. so randall drove about 50 miles to the border, picked up the medicine and brought it back to penticton.  she said she produced nine eggs, six of which were viable. five embryos were then created, but only three made it through the first week. of those three, randall said, only one did not have a high risk of leading to a miscarriage.  “we would have loved to have three, but we got one, and you have about a 60 percent chance of that becoming a viable pregnancy,” she said.  randall and ellis have nicknamed the surviving embryo little frosty.  “he’s hanging out in seattle in storage, and they can keep embryos up to 10 years,” she said.  randall said she expected to be on anti-hormone medication for at least five years, possibly as long as 10. pregnancy is not advisable during such treatment, although randall said she might be able to take a break from the medication to pursue having a child.  “if we only ever end up with breck, he’s amazing,” randall said.            image        the view from randall's home in penticton, british columbia.        the family moved to penticton for a job opportunity for ellis, a former 400-meter hurdler for canada, who was later an elite cross-country skier. but he said he left his new job in july to play a bigger role with breck and to have more flexibility to help randall.        after they moved to canada for ellis’s career, randall’s pursuits are again taking precedence.   the couple now work together out of the house, focusing on randall’s business and charitable opportunities .  her regimen includes training in the small workout room on the ground floor. last friday morning, she put herself through a brisk circuit of weight lifting, dips, resistance band work and other exercises that she has tried to maintain since entering what she calls her g.i. jane phase. she shaved her head after her hair began to fall out in clumps early in chemotherapy.  randall likes to do laundry between sets, and her deep breathing was often drowned out by the sound of a washing machine shifting through its cycles. bottles of detergent share space on shelves with mementos from her and ellis’s athletic careers.  a photo of the gold medal finish from pyeongchang, with diggins’s arms thrust triumphantly skyward, sits atop a baseboard heater where randall can see it as she sweats. though there are signs of the strain, such as dark half-circles under her eyes, she looks lean and fit.  “thankfully all the muscles didn’t go away,” she said.            image        randall with her son, breck, and her husband, jeff ellis, at the nickel plate nordic centre.        she has put them to use: biking to and from her cancer treatments in anchorage and hopping on skis very soon after her lumpectomy, using only one pole for a time to avoid overworking her right side. in september, she won a 10-kilometer run in penticton, and last month, while still finishing radiation treatment, she won the women’s event at a duathlon ski race in anchorage.        “i don’t think cancer patients are told enough what they  can  do,” she said.  randall, who has a port implanted in her chest to continue receiving injections of the drug herceptin, wants to promote physical activity during treatment. she has taken inspiration from and spoken with gabriele grunewald, the 32-year-old american middle-distance runner, who has continued to compete despite dealing with more virulent forms of cancer.           chemotherapy, then the u.s. championships, for gabriele grunewald  june 19, 2017            randall has no plans to return to top-level competition and has not skied more than 30 kilometers since her cancer diagnosis, but she will take part in the american birkebeiner, a 50-kilometer ski marathon in hayward, wis., on saturday. she then heads to china to take part in sprint ski races in the bird’s nest stadium as part of the buildup to the 2022 winter olympics in beijing. in november, she intends to run the new york city marathon.  she also has regular meetings as a member of the international olympic committee and the board of the u.s.o.c. those positions don’t come with a salary, so she needs to generate regular income through speaking engagements and sponsorships.  the whirlwind, if she stays healthy, will resume soon enough. but last saturday, with the weather and the agenda clear, she and ellis packed their minivan with gear and drove about 45 minutes west to the groomed cross-country trails of nickel plate nordic centre.  ellis    clicked into his bindings and towed breck in a carrier with randall whooping alongside them as they headed down a gentle slope. later, as she sprinted across the snow on her own, the rest of her family took a break.  “after everything, it’s great to see her out there on skis,” ellis said. “it’s her happy place.”            image        randall training on apex mountain, near her home.       \",\n",
       " 'london — the president of japan’s olympic committee has been indicted on corruption charges in france after an investigation into the bidding process that led to tokyo’s being awarded the summer games it is preparing to host next year.  the committee president, tsunekazu takeda, a former olympian who is also the chairman of the international olympic committee’s marketing commission, was charged by an investigating judge on dec. 10, a spokeswoman for france’s financial crimes prosecutor confirmed. she said mr. takeda had met with the judge, but she declined to provide further information because the case was continuing.  in a statement, mr. takeda acknowledged that he had been questioned by the french authorities but denied their accusations.  the news is yet another blow to the credibility of the olympic movement, which has been battered by a number of corruption cases linked to previous olympic bids and the ongoing repercussions of  a widespread russian doping operation  at the 2014 winter olympics.        the international olympic committee said in a statement that its ethics commission had opened a file on the most recent charges and that it would “continue to monitor the situation.”  “mr. takeda continues to enjoy the full presumption of innocence,” it added.  tokyo was awarded the 2020 summer games at a meeting of the committee in buenos aires in 2013. france’s financial crimes prosecutors have long suspected that the victory was tainted after they uncovered payments linked to papa massata diack, a former marketing official with track and field’s governing body, the international association of athletics federations.  prosecutors contend that money was paid to african olympic committee officials for their votes. they also accuse  mr. diack, whom france has sought to extradite  from his native senegal for several years, of facilitating and accepting bribes from officials behind rio de janeiro’s successful bid to host the 2016 summer olympics.  last year, following a joint operation with the french authorities, brazilian prosecutors filed a corruption case against the former head of brazil’s olympic committee,  carlos arthur nuzman .  though mr. takeda, a former equestrian competitor, has been placed under formal investigation on corruption charges, it is not clear whether he will stand trial.        in france, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers, who place defendants under formal investigation when they believe the evidence points to serious wrongdoing. but the magistrates can later drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed to trial.  in 2016, french prosecutors said they had uncovered more than $2 million in payments made by tokyo’s bidding committee to a little-known singaporean company, black tidings, during the competition to host the 2020 olympics. that company was found to belong to a close friend of mr. diack’s.  the japanese authorities, at the request of their french counterparts, questioned mr. takeda about those payments in 2017 but have taken no action since. officials said the payments were for consulting work, and a panel commissioned by the japanese olympic committee said in 2016 that it had found that the payments were legitimate.  it was unclear whether the japanese committee would reopen is investigation in light of the french charges. calls to the committee went unanswered late friday.  tokyo beat out rivals madrid and istanbul to win the summer olympics for the first time since 1964. back then, the olympics symbolized japan’s recovery from world war ii; similarly, organizers in japan had seen the 2020 games as a chance to show the world that their country was bouncing back from the devastating march 2011 tsunami and the nuclear disaster at fukushima. now, suggestions that corruption played a role in japan’s triumph have cast a pall over the preparations.  the former prime minister yoshiro mori, who leads the  tokyo olympics organizing committee , told the fuji news network that he was “simply shocked” by france’s move. the organizing committee was set up jointly by the japanese olympic committee and the tokyo metropolitan government, and mr. takeda serves as one of its vice presidents.  “perhaps perceptions differ from those of japan, and i hope this is a mistake,” mr. mori said.  mr. takeda is the second olympic luminary to face serious legal action in recent months. in november,  sheikh ahmed al sabah , a member of kuwait’s royal family and close ally of the i.o.c. president, thomas bach, temporarily stepped down from the committee after being accused by the swiss authorities in a forgery case. he was also identified in 2017 as an unindicted co-conspirator in a soccer corruption filed case by the united states department of justice. he denies all the allegations.        the international olympic committee has stressed that it has implemented reforms to its bidding process since rio de janeiro’s and tokyo’s victories.  that has not prevented a public backlash against the games in several prospective host cities. several cities vying for the 2026 winter games pulled out, leaving just two, and there remain question marks over whether one of the bidders, stockholm, will remain in the race ahead of a decision later this year.

       " 'some of the world’s top biathletes descended this weekend on utah for the first time in 17 years. the return for a world cup event comes as salt lake city promotes its bid to host the 2030 olympics.  for armin auchentaller, the italian national who began overseeing the united states women’s team last spring, the needs are more immediate. biathlon, which combines nordic skiing and target shooting, is the only winter olympic sport in which team usa has never won a medal.  auchentaller’s job is to change that. in a recent phone interview from utah, where the team was preparing for competitions at soldier hollow, auchentaller cited his experience coaching the swiss biathlon team, which, like the united states, is not considered at the pinnacle of the sport. he said it had helped him understand how to take a team from nowhere to a place where where landing on an olympic podium is possible, as the swiss did in 2014.  here are edited excerpts from the interview with auchentaller.     you want to put an american on an olympic podium. were you an olympian?          i was good skier and good biathlete, but not good enough. but i was coaching with switzerland from 2014 to 2018, and we had good results. i built up the team there, because there wasn’t really much of a women’s team when i arrived. but by the end, we were able to get some results in the top 10.     what is the most important factor in creating a successful team here?   it’s not the successful sport here that it is in the european countries. we have just a few athletes, but those athletes we have, they are so committed and they have great personalities. the important thing is to work with them and get them better every single day.     did the top biathletes here grow up with the sport?   many of them were college cross-country skiers, and after they received their degree, they switched. so it’s very challenging to learn to shoot, to learn the game — what they can do, what they cannot do during a competition.     you could train me forever, and i would never be able to dunk a basketball or hit a 90-mile-per-hour fastball. can you teach someone to be a great shot?    everybody should have a little bit of talent to start. but it’s important to remember some of the great champions were not great shooters when they were young. i am convinced i can teach you shooting.           what is the hardest thing about shooting?   the most tricky thing is not technical, it’s the mental part, the emotional part, especially when it comes down to hit the last chart [target]. even the best biathletes, they have the technical qualities and skills, but the last shot is the hardest.     what americans have the best chance to get to a podium?    sean doherty on the men’s side. for the women, it’s susan dunklee and clare egan.     what is the key to their progress?    the main thing is try to be as consistent as possible. if you have too many ups and downs, the chances may be not as high, but if you are consistent, at some point you will get there. remember, in our sport, you can be in the lead, and if you miss on the last chart, instead of being on the podium, you can be 30th.     do u.s. biathletes have enough support?   we need even more private sponsors for the athletes to be able to pay their flights and other costs. the u.s.o.c. is our biggest sponsor, and we do have two or three minor sponsors, but we need the big ones especially to be able to develop the young athletes.     guns are very controversial in the united states, but they are popular with a large segment of the population. is that an advantage?    i definitely see it as an advantage. in the u.s., it can seem like everyone has a gun. we should use this, the popularity of these sport guns.     how is the fan support in the united states?   i wish it would it would be more popular in the u.s. if people get to know this sport, i know it will be very popular.

of uzbekistan’s leading criminals” won the a.i.b.a. presidency and took control of the world governing body.  that man, gafur rakhimov, a russian citizen, had been a.i.b.a.’s interim leader after  his predecessor, c. k. wu, was forced out  following a  financial scandal that pushed the organization to the brink of bankruptcy . the scandal raised questions — many still unanswered — regarding the whereabouts of millions of dollars of a.i.b.a. revenue.  to his supporters, rakhimov is seen as the federation’s savior because of deals he cut with a.i.b.a. creditors. to the i.o.c., his appointment is the latest misstep by an organization that has lurched from crisis to crisis, including questions about the fairness of boxing judges and a.i.b.a.’s antidoping measures.        the i.o.c. will decide at a meeting on dec. 1 whether to cast out a.i.b.a. if it does, the i.o.c. will have to scramble to organize an olympic boxing competition for the tokyo games that the boxing federation has not sanctioned.  the i.o.c. ordered the federation earlier this year to produce a report outlining plans to resolve some longstanding issues. people familiar with the i.o.c.’s thinking say the a.i.b.a. has little hope for a reprieve. the i.o.c. is already planning ways to preserve boxing’s place in tokyo.  it would take “something earth shattering” for a.i.b.a. not to be thrown out, said a person with knowledge of the discussions who declined to be identified because those talks are continuing. for its part, boxing federation has accused the i.o.c. of double standards, pointing out that the organization has not dealt with a number of its members facing accusations of wrongdoing and is meddling in the internal workings of a sports federation.  rakhimov is fighting to clear his name with the treasury department, which in december accused him of  “providing material support” to the thieves-in-law, an international crime syndicate  centered on the former soviet union. rakhimov denies the allegations, saying they are linked to politically motivated charges, now dropped, by members of the former government in uzbekistan.  in a statement emailed through a media adviser, rakhimov said: “ i have never been involved in any transnational criminal organizations or any other criminal activities. i have never been convicted or charged with any crime.”        the treasury department’s designation creates major operational challenges for rakhimov and a problem for an olympic movement that is battling to restore its own damaged reputation amid the yearslong russian doping scandal and a dearth of cities  that want to host the winter games .  “the i.o.c. has made it clear from the outset that there are issues of grave concern with a.i.b.a. regarding judging, finance and the antidoping program, and with governance — which includes but is not limited to the election of the a.i.b.a. president,” the i.o.c. spokesman mark adams said in a statement.  “whatever the results of the deliberations of the i.o.c. executive board, we will continue to make all efforts to protect the athletes and to have a boxing tournament at the olympic games tokyo 2020,” adams continued. the i.o.c. has frozen all contact with a.i.b.a., except those necessary to carry out i.o.c. decisions.  in his emailed comments, rakhimov repeated an offer to temporarily step down, but only “if the i.o.c. and a.i.b.a. are communicating at the decision-making level.”  “in fact,” he added via email, “i believe we will be able to re-establish a good relationship with the i.o.c., which will include tokyo 2020 and any future olympic games.”        image     gafur rakhimov, the controversy-plagued president of the federation.   credit  pavel golovkin/associated press       tom virgets, an american who was appointed  executive director of a.i.b.a . by rakhimov earlier this year, said the boxing federation had made great strides in making changes to its governance structure. without rakhimov’s ability to make deals with creditors, the organization probably would have already had to shut its doors, he said.        a chinese company, f.c.i.t., has effectively written off a $19 million investment in a.i.b.a. it has committed an additional $1 million a year for the rights to market and promote a.i.b.a. events for the next 20 years. wu di, an executive with f.c.i.t., was recently added to a.i.b.a.’s decision-making executive committee. two other spots are available for officials from companies who would be willing to commit a minimum $10 million each, according to a.i.b.a.’s regulations.  virgets, who had been a senior associate athletic director at the united states naval academy, acknowledged that rakhimov’s notoriety presented problems.  “is this the best person to run a.i.b.a.? obviously not because they have some level of controversy,” virgets said. “it would be much better if he wasn’t on that list, and it would be much better if we had someone with his skill-set who could manage this crisis for a.i.b.a. but quite frankly, i haven’t seen that individual who could manage this crisis.”  the treasury department’s designation accuses rakhimov of collaborating with the thieves-in-law organization on business, arranging meetings and warning it of law enforcement issues. “rakhimov has been described as having moved from extortion and car theft to becoming one of uzbekistan’s leading criminals and an important person involved in the heroin trade,” the department said in a statement.  that makes him toxic for businesses and individuals with links to the united states, including those dealing with a.i.b.a. switzerland’s vaud cantonal bank said it could no longer work with the boxing federation. a.i.b.a. then took its banking operations to serbia. the i.o.c. did not let rakhimov, who is based in dubai, attend the youth olympics last month. the british authorities blocked him from attending the 2012 olympics in london, and he was also denied a visa for the 2008 games in beijing.  rakhimov’s moscow-based lawyer, yuri kuznetsov, has spent years trying to clear his client’s name. he has tried to persuade the authorities in russia, the united arab emirates, uzbekistan and even interpol to show the i.o.c. that rakhimov is no longer a fugitive.  kuznetsov, during an interview in london last month, conceded that rakhimov had to deal with unsavory characters after the fall of the soviet union, when he made his fortune importing foodstuffs.        “of course he was not planning to rob a bank, he was not planning to make a crime, he had to meet with these people because they were controlling business,” he said.  pat fiacco, a canadian appointed to a.i.b.a.’s executive committee by rakhimov, said the i.o.c.’s treatment of rakhimov was starting to feel like a violation of his human rights. he said even as the i.o.c. had been critical of rakhimov, it had failed to police its own members who face accusations of wrongdoing.  those include the vice chairman of the i.o.c. commission overseeing the 2020 olympics, who is accused of sexual harassment in israel, and a kuwaiti sheikh identified as an unindicted co-conspirator by the united states justice department in a sports-corruption case last year.  wu, who resigned as a.i.b.a. president last year amid accusations — that he denies — of financial mismanagement, remains an i.o.c. member. sheikh ahmad al-fahad al-sabah stepped down temporarily monday from the i.o.c. amid allegations by swiss prosecutors of forgery.  at the youth olympics in argentina last month, the i.o.c. hired the accounting firm pwc to oversee the judging at the boxing event after previous tournaments were mired by accusations of rigged decisions. virgets said steps had been taken to address those challenges and deal with 38 doping cases dating to 2010 that had not been tackled by the previous leadership.  documentation of the corrective measures taken by a.i.b.a. and a file with letters exonerating rakhimov from the authorities in russia and uzbekistan has been sent to the i.o.c., virgets said.  “i’d be the first person here to say, ‘if you can show evidence that gafur rakhimov is guilty, don’t just remove him from a.i.b.a., but put him in jail,’ ” virgets said.

       " 'sarah hirshland took over as chief executive of the united states olympic committee at a fraught time. the organization was reeling from heavy criticism over its response, or its lack of one, to the sexual abuse accusations against lawrence g. nassar, then a team doctor for u.s.a. gymnastics.  now, after six months in the job, hirshland spoke with reporters and editors of the new york times about some of the issues that have dominated the early part of her tenure.  hirshland began the discussion by highlighting four key areas.   hirshland:  the first is, maintaining clear focus on the mission to empower athletes to succeed on the highest level, on the grandest stages, and doing so in an environment that provides them the safety, the resources and the tools they need to be successful in that adventure.  the second is ensuring that athletes have a voice and a seat at the table as the organization is making decisions. they have to play a critical part not only on the field of play but off the field of play.        the third is striving for an environment in the olympic movement that’s free of abuse. there’s some work that’s been done, work that’s being done and work that we need to do.  the fourth is focusing on stewarding the olympic and paralympic movement in this country as we think about our role on the global stage.  excerpts from the interview with hirshland are below:    do you need federal funding at this point? for decades, you got no federal funding. is it time to say we need to get a lot of money from the federal government?   one of the things i hope to do is identify the revenue gap between the size of the pie today and what we think a reasonable size of the pie could and should be to provide the funding to all of the athletes who have the capability to compete at the olympic and paralympic level. there is a revenue gap. if every athlete who had the talent to compete had the tools they needed, what would that number be?  i can’t tell you today what that revenue gap is. then the question becomes, what’s the best way to fill it?          will you push for government funding for the u.s. center for safesport?   every meeting i’ve had in washington, i’ve asked for money for the center for safesport.    how much?   we asked for, it was before my time, i think $5 million a year. what came back was $2.5 million over five years.  i don’t think there’s an easy answer that says, yes, the government’s going to fund this to this amount and here’s where it’s going to come from. we don’t have any confidence that real funding is going to come at this point.    i would think it would be a priority to get it funded properly because it’s sadly underfunded.   the center asked us for $6.2 million next year. we said yes. they haven’t come back and said we need more money.    there are coaches that have been banned who are still coaching. these guys are still out there. sources have said they put in a complaint to safesport and no one got back to them. they probably need a lot more money not only for policing but education.   there is no doubt that the capacity of the center is not where it needs to be to handle the volume. my understanding is that they are growing and hiring as fast as they can. funding is not the issue; it’s capacity and growth rate. it’s a huge priority for us. but at the same time, it’s an independent organization that’s accountable to its board. we have given them every dollar they have asked for. if safesport needs more money, i certainly hope that they will ask for it.    there’s still fallout from all the lawsuits. are you confident the u.s.o.c. will survive? will it have to declare bankruptcy?         i am confident, based on the information i have today, that we will be able to resolve the litigation and be strong and healthy as we go forward.  we take the litigation and our responsibility very seriously. the olympic movement failed these athletes, and we absolutely have a moral and ethical obligation.    how have the sponsorships changed? have you had trouble gaining new sponsorships or lost a lot of sponsorships?   we have not. it’s been a natural process: sometimes a sponsor doesn’t renew and you add a new sponsor, that’s a natural evolution. the numbers and the revenue are not markedly different.    what’s an early look at the los angeles olympics? are people going to be excited about l.a.?   based on really early measures, the answer is absolutely yes. the energy around it is very positive. but this will ebb and flow. we’re still a little bit in the honeymoon of the news that it’s coming.    you’re interfacing with a troubled movement internationally. they’re getting turned down by cities. there has been enormous corruption. it’s a troubled model. how do you fit into that? is there a larger, existential problem?   and yet there are thousands of athletes whose lives are changed for the better constantly by this movement. there’s no doubt there are two sides to the coin. you can’t get too focused on the side you just described that you lose sight of the side i choose to spend more time thinking about.        fundamentally, the olympics and sports in general are about breaking down barriers and uniting people. the complexities of the system continue to expose challenges and the need for change.  we have to set the example, and we have to play better ourselves. we can’t possibly solve all of that if we don’t have our own house in order.    do you think the current olympic model works? every four years having a new city hosting the olympics?   it’s fiscally not responsible to create the infrastructure for an olympic games just for an olympic games. that can’t work. a city has to either need the infrastructure and use the olympics to accelerate its development, or the infrastructure has to exist. the notion that we’re going to go here and build the infrastructure for the olympics is not sustainable.  as we looked at opportunities for the winter games, that’s an incredibly compelling reality of salt lake city. there is not a construction requirement there to host an olympic games.    are there other cities in the pipeline?   we have been very clear in selecting salt lake, to not encourage other cities to prepare to host a winter games. we have determined that salt lake is our best foot forward for the winter. and we are not even contemplating summer beyond l.a.    how confident are you that l.a. will make a profit?   i feel really good about l.a. it’s 10 years out, but the fundamental economic model is really strong because the infrastructure is where the huge part of the cost is. and the infrastructure was either there or was already in the plan to be built as part of l.a.’s natural development.          under your predecessor, the staff of the u.s.o.c. would get bonuses depending on the performance of the athletes at the olympics. is that a good model?   one of the things i’ve changed is the staff incentive model for 2019. there is still a component of athletic success, but it is much more based on a variety of components.    what has the last six months been like?   i logged 115,000 miles in my first five months. i had to make choices about going deep or going broad. i went really broad and met a lot of people at a cursory level. now i’m starting to home in on priorities.  it feels now like a manageable intake, like i have enough space mentally and time to start to take control and implement change.  the only way i can be good and strong for the organization is to keep myself strong mentally and physically. i’m working hard to make sure this doesn’t consume me.  i can’t be fearful on this job. being fearful on this job is not a recipe for success.

       " 'wabasha, minn. — in the weeks before the olympic cyclist kelly catlin killed herself, she felt her mind slipping.  she could not focus on her schoolwork at stanford, where she was a first-year graduate student in computational mathematics. in an email she sent to her family, a coach and a friend in january, she said her thoughts were “never-ending spinning, spinning, spinning” as if they were “never at rest, never at peace.”  she wrote that she cried about it, and that made her feel even worse. for years, catlin, 23, was someone who took pride in holding back tears.  catlin told her sister, christine, that seeking therapy meant she was weak and that she would rather suffer. she told her brother, colin, that she thought she was going insane and she worried that she was a danger to others because she was filled with rage.        she wrote that she was scared of dying.  “what is it like to no longer have a mind?” she wrote in january, just days before a first suicide attempt. she answered the question.  “it is unimaginable,” she wrote. “terrifying.”  catlin was poised for stardom at the 2020 olympics in tokyo, where she had a reasonable shot for olympic gold that eluded her in 2016. with the advanced degree from stanford she was working toward, she could have her pick of jobs in computers.  how, those who knew her are asking now, could she find no purpose to keep living? how could she be so unknown to the people closest to her?  kelly catlin had sought to explain herself and her distress, both over the phone and in notes before she was found dead in her stanford apartment on march 8. in one note she wrote in january, she even asked, “what do you wish to know?”, leaving a trail of cryptic answers.            image     kelly catlin’s brother, colin, sifts through the belongings retrieved from her graduate student apartment at stanford, hoping for clues explaining why she took her life last month at age 23.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         “you think you know your children,” her mother, carolyn emory, said, “but there was so much about kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end. she was very private.”        on friday, a month after she killed herself, a white van showed up at her parents’ farmhouse to drop off her things.  three bikes. nearly a dozen boxes of clothes, books and cycling gear. her carbon-fiber violin. duffel bags stuffed with cycling gear and united states olympic team uniforms from the 2016 rio games, where she won a silver medal.  her mother and her brother, colin catlin, sifted through the belongings, retrieved from her apartment. her father, dr. mark catlin, could only join them in spurts because he was so distraught.  every item provoked a memory, none a clue.  colin catlin had hoped to find telling information on her phone, but instead he found the wallpaper she selected for it haunting: an album cover featuring a body with daggers in its back. the album title was “try to die.”  he broke into tears.  it was hard to absorb that just months before, in november, on the podium at a world cup track cycling race, where catlin’s squad finished second in the team pursuit, she soaked in the moment: flags waving, fans cheering, adrenaline pumping. a three-time world champion, catlin considered the victory a prelude to finally winning an olympic gold medal.  off the track, she was fulfilling a lifelong obsession with numbers and order through her academics and planning for a career in silicon valley.        this solid trajectory she appeared to be on had made her mental downward spiral and death all the more mystifying to teammates, friends and family members.  catlin’s father, who is a pathologist, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries from a january suicide attempt about a month before she was found dead in her dorm. on both occasions, she inhaled noxious gas.            image        kelly catlin, second from the left, and her teammates celebrate a silver medal in the women’s team pursuit at the 2016 rio olympic games.   credit  bryn lennon/getty images         but the breaking point, he and other family members believe, was a concussion she sustained during a training ride on jan. 5. they have donated her brain to researchers to find out if the head injury contributed to her behavior changes.  regardless of the results, nothing can give the family a definitive answer. suicide is much more complicated than lab results can reveal and multiple factors, like destabilizing life events, brain chemistry and persistent mental struggles, almost always come into play.  “i wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,” said her father, whose eyes were reddened by weeks of crying. “i can’t help but wonder what she would’ve done with her life.”  kelly’s mother answered, weeping, “something great.”  ‘never love’  catlin and her triplet siblings, christine and colin, grew up in arden hills, minn., a suburb of minneapolis. her parents — her mother is a former alzheimer’s researcher — met in a lab dissecting brains.        the catlins lived in a large house with an indoor gymnasium. they took european vacations and roasted s’mores in the backyard. they were a family of introverts who enjoyed staying at home for tea parties. for kelly, christine and colin, school and sports were equally important. they excelled at both.  kelly was the super-focused athlete, a first-chair violinist who studied nonstop. christine was the creative writer and runner who played three instruments. colin was the math whiz who played guitar and rode bikes competitively. in middle school, the siblings tied for most likely to succeed.  “our parents always told us that we could be great at anything we wanted to, if we worked hard enough,” christine said. “looking back, maybe we kind of twisted that into thinking we weren’t worth anything if we weren’t the best. i think kelly believed that.”  kelly’s parents said she was an intense child who grew socially awkward with age. in elementary school, when she could not figure out addition or subtraction, she would scream for hours in frustration, they said, and refused to take a break.  for years in her youth, she was obsessed with horses. she studied the 512-page book “the ultimate book of the horse and rider” so much that she had to tape the binding because the book was so worn. she maintained a collection of dozens of model horses that she did not allow anyone to touch because they were arranged in a certain order.            image        “you think you know your children, but there was so much about kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end,” catlin’s mother, carolyn emory, said.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         christine catlin described her sister as a once outgoing, friendly girl who began closing herself off in middle school because she was “so obsessed with success.”        kelly catlin also began to limit her social interactions to “robotic social motions,” as catlin herself put it in the january note to family and friends. around third grade, catlin established her lifelong code to live by and included some of it in the note, which was shared with the new york times:   fear not physical discomfort. never love. never engage in a relationship that could be defined as having a significant other. (in my case, a so-called “boyfriend.”) never allow yourself to become close enough to another that their actions or inactions might cause you (any amount of) distress or pain. if kindness and gentleness are at all an option, they are the only option.    “we all knew that she didn’t like to express her emotions,” christine catlin said. “she never really told anyone how she ever felt, until the very end, that is.”  cycling calls  colin and christine catlin were cycling for a local development team, northstar, when kelly quit high school soccer and joined them, at colin’s prodding. she loved long training rides and used cycling as a way to practice memorization, another passion.  she would remember dozens of license plates of cars passing her and would recite the number pi to hundreds of decimals, colin catlin said. she mapped out training routes in her head.  “she liked that cycling kept her mind focused, but i think she liked it most when she started winning everything,” said colin, a data scientist. “her mentality was, if you wanted to be an olympian, all you had to do was train hard.”  and kelly did make it seem easy. within two years of starting to race, she was invited to the united states olympic training center in colorado, where coaches put cyclists through testing to see if they are national team material. kelly was that, and more.  her power output on the stationary bike was higher than every other recruit and higher than several athletes on the national track cycling team, said neal henderson, one of the coaches back then.        track cyclists compete on a banked oval, called a velodrome, and catlin seemed suited for it because it required both power and precision.            image        kelly catlin, second from left, with jennifer valente, chloe dygert and kimberly geist, during the women&rsquo;s team pursuit final at the world championships in march 2018. the u.s. team won the gold medal.   credit  peter dejong/associated press         she was drawn to the science of cycling. she wasn’t comfortable with the social aspect of it. in the notes she wrote in her final weeks, she acknowledged not having many friends.  “it’s not that she didn’t want friends,” her brother said. “it was just a matter of priorities. and her priority was to be successful and respected.”  like her siblings, catlin could not stand to be hugged, family members said. she would rather bury herself in a book than chat with peers. she had a playful sense of humor — often dark humor — within her family circle, but rarely showed it to outsiders.  although she exuded confidence, she described in a note having a “phenomenally powerful fear of social embarrassment,” and also long worried that she would not be able to keep up with other cyclists, said charlie and sherry townsend, the co-founders of her development team. it was a classic impostor syndrome, they said.  “but she changed because of cycling, she really did,” said sherry townsend, a psychologist, adding that catlin’s self-esteem rose after she competed in the olympics. “she was slowly learning how to be better engaged with people, slowly learning how to share her thoughts with others. but it was still hard to really know her.”        catlin’s nickname at the olympic training center, where she lived before the 2016 olympics, was roy orbison, because she always wore dark glasses. she wore her hair short because it was practical for the sport, so short that she was sometimes mistaken for a young man.  chloé dygert, an olympic teammate, said she was thrilled when catlin started to open up, even occasionally agreeing to a quick hug. dygert and a teammate once convinced catlin to play the violin for them.  “it was, like, whoa, so good that it was jaw-dropping,” dygert said. “kelly was just amazing. she read a book every day, even while brushing her teeth, and it was hard to keep up. she was a lovely girl on the inside.”  a concussion, then changes  the concussion that her family said changed everything happened on jan. 5 when catlin crashed while riding with her professional road cycling team, rally uhc cycling. a team spokesman said there was “no indication that she hit her head or had a serious injury” when the team evaluated her.            image        catlin’s father, dr. mark catlin, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         but at a national team training camp two days later, catlin felt dizzy and could not continue working out. she told the team about her crash. medical personnel at the olympic training center placed her on concussion protocol and suggested rest, said guillermo rojas, a spokesman for usa cycling.  yet catlin continued to complain to her parents of headaches, sensitivity to light and trouble sleeping. and this was coming months after a fall in october that left her with a broken arm and weakened interest in the national team.        “there was this profound apathy,” her father said. “she didn’t care about winning medals anymore.”  life at stanford was much different than she was used to. she moved into a dorm there after living with her brother at the university of minnesota while finishing her undergraduate degree. colin had cooked her meals and often had to trick her into taking breaks from studying and training, playing episodes of the television show “stargate” because she could not resist science fiction.  at stanford, she spent a lot of time alone because her roommate, a law student, was often not there.  after the concussion, catlin simply could not focus anymore on school or cycling — or anything. in late january, she wrote that she had started planning her suicide before her crash and concussion. but her family thinks that was not true.  “for the first time in her life, miss stoical couldn’t force herself to go on,” her father said, choking up. “this is when she began planning her suicide.”  after her first suicide attempt, catlin spent about a week in a hospital psychiatric ward. when she left that treatment, she began attending group therapy sessions, which she deemed useless, her parents said, and she said she could not find an available psychiatrist who met her needs.  when catlin moved back into her on-campus apartment, her parents flew home to minnesota to give her space, telling her, “we love you, we want you alive,” her father said. they banked on her assurances that she wouldn’t try to kill herself again. she had given her word, a part of her personal code they knew.  “she fooled us all,” her mother said.  the suicide attempt and concussion had damaged her brain and heart, her family said, so competing at the world championships on feb. 27 was not possible. the day the championships began, catlin wrote a blog post in which she described managing her cycling career with her graduate studies as “juggling with knives” and said, “i really am dropping a lot of them.” in a note she wrote in march, she said, “if i am not an athlete, i am nothing.”            image        kelly catlin’s grave at lakewood cemetery in minneapolis.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         looking back, her father said, it was clear she needed time for her brain to heal, but it appeared nobody could impress that on her.  he said her lifelong resolve played a big factor in trying to kill herself again.  “she was furious that she survived her first suicide attempt,” her father said.  a last call  christine catlin’s phone rang in late february, and it was kelly. they had not spoken at length in years because they were busy with their own lives after high school, but now kelly wanted to talk. christine found it strange. it was nothing kelly would have done before her concussion.  kelly said she worried that the physical effects of her concussion or her first suicide attempt — or both — were affecting her judgment.  she asked: what could christine see her doing in the future?  the sister answered: you could do public speaking about suicide awareness and help people. or you could do remote computer programming so you don’t have to be around people. you could own a farm and be around horses all day.  “you could bike, if you want to,” christine said. “or not.”  kelly seemed to feel better after the call, which lasted two and a half hours.        still, she told christine, “if things don’t change in a month, i’m probably going to kill myself.”  christine begged kelly not to do it.  “o.k.,” kelly said, with a tone christine now realizes was less than convincing.  the call was over. christine rushed to call her parents, and for days afterward the family repeatedly checked on kelly. two weeks after that conversation, catlin’s life was over.  at a memorial service in minneapolis on march 23, kelly catlin was dressed in the uniform the united states team wore for the rio games opening ceremony, and the majority of her pallbearers were her cycling teammates. she was buried at the foot of a 50-foot oak tree at lakewood cemetery, near one of

       " 'the archetype of the olympian is evolving, as evidenced by the potential arrival of a new sort of athletic competitor at the summer games: b-boys and b-girls.  as part of an effort to appeal to younger fans, the organizing committee for the 2024 games in paris announced on thursday that it would recommend break dancing — yes, the street dance form with moves like flares, headspins and windmills — as a new sport to be added to its program.  the proposal — which also includes a recommendation that skateboarding, surfing and climbing, which will be introduced next year at the tokyo games, remain on the program — will be formally presented to the international olympic committee executive board at the end of march. the i.o.c. is not expected to confirm the events program for the 2024 games until december 2020.  break dancing was enthusiastically received when it made its  debut at the youth olympic games  last summer in buenos aires. the eventual medalists there hailed from russia, france, japan, south korea, canada, italy, austria, vietnam and argentina — a vivid sign perhaps of how extensively the activity has spread since its beginnings decades ago in new york city.        “breaking has two elements,” nakari shigeyuki, a japanese teenager known as shigekix who won a bronze medal at the youth event, told olympic.org in october. “one is sports, and one is arts. we need the stamina of athletes, but we also need to be artists, and express our feelings.”            image     besides break dancing, organizers hope to add surfing, skateboarding and climbing to the 2024 games.   credit  lionel bonaventure/agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         the sport’s potential moment in the global spotlight arrives as the i.o.c. continues its efforts to engage new fans — particularly young ones — in a sports landscape flowering with alternatives to the traditional olympic program.  to that end, the i.o.c. created new rules recently to allow host cities to recommend new sports for the olympics program. organizers for the 2020 games in toyko proposed baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, which the i.o.c. eventually approved. (because host city recommendations are valid for one olympic games only, karate and baseball/softball will not return in paris.)  paris 2024 organizers said their aim was to include “sports that can be shared on social media, sports that are a means of getting around, forms of expression, lifestyles in their own right, sports that are practiced every day, in the street and elsewhere.”        the organizers said their values led them to “sustainable and socially responsible” sports that do not require permanent facilities; sports that will engage young people and those in urban communities; and sports that are culturally relevant to france.  another initiative in that vein will be the opportunity for amateurs to run the olympic marathon course after the official race has ended (which is, in essence, how most major marathons in the world operate, with a group of professional competitors preceding a larger, amateur field).  in their break dancing proposal, paris 2024 organizers said there would be men’s and women’s events with a total of 32 athletes who would officially be referred to as b-boys and b-girls.  the competitions, meanwhile, would be referred to as “battles” and feature dancers taking turns performing dance moves and spins on the floor. each routine would be graded, the organizers said, on criteria “such as technique, variety, performance, musicality, creativity and personality.”       ',\n",
       " 'steamboat springs, colo. — tara geraghty-moats was 11 the first time she took a big trip for a ski competition. her mother insisted she was still too young to travel with a team, so the pair set off from vermont, boarded a plane and flew to steamboat springs for the 2005 ski jumping and nordic combined junior olympics.  she was so excited at the opportunity to compete in a national nordic combined event that she had personal-best days on both sides of the sport: cross-country skiing, where she finished the five-kilometer race so quickly that she did not beat her time again until she was 18, and ski jumping, where she summoned the courage to fly from one of the complex’s big jumps for the first time.  “i didn’t even know enough to be scared,” she said. “that was such an awesome week.”  nearly 14 years later, again in steamboat springs, geraghty-moats struggled to stay upright after yet another big breakthrough. she planted her ski poles in the snow and leaned into them before looking up with a wide, bright grin on a dark, cold night. emotions swirled, joy and relief mixing at the finish line for the first senior international women’s nordic combined competition ever contested on north american snow.         image        tara geraghty-moats in the ski jumping portion of a nordic combined competition on dec. 15 in steamboat springs, colo., where she competed when she was 11 in 2005.   credit  joel reichenberger for the new york times       image        &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve all chosen a path that isn&rsquo;t the standard one, and maybe not even the recommended one, but we&rsquo;re here because we love the sport,&rdquo; geraghty-moats said.   credit  joel reichenberger for the new york times        she had waited so long for this, and she won big, by 47.7 seconds. that, in some ways, is not actually a good thing.         nordic combined is the only olympic sport, summer or winter, without a women’s division. that is expected to change at some point, but not everything that night in steamboat springs gave the impression of an event ready for the spotlight.  geraghty-moats, 25, won by topping a field of only 14 athletes. some were a decade younger than her, and others entered the competition having barely practiced. skiers finished five, seven and even 11 minutes off the pace, an eternity for a 5k. that disparity in talent kept packs from forming, so most athletes raced alone on the dark course, its far, cold corners lit dimly by small banks of led lights powered by gas generators.   the fewer than 150 fans who were there largely stayed huddled close to a smoky bonfire near the finish line. it smoldered beneath the nearly empty stands of a rodeo arena converted in winter for ski races. many who did show up were there primarily to watch a concurrent men’s competition.  still, women’s nordic combined is going somewhere.  the hope from international organizers was to have it in the next olympics, in 2022 in beijing. but four years into a plan to fast-track the sport’s growth, the schedule has been derailed, prompting questions about what sports belong in the olympics, and when they should be added.         nordic combined has been a part of the winter olympics since the first games, in 1924 in chamonix, france — longer than signature events such as alpine skiing and, by 74 years, snowboarding. the sport had always been limited to men at the international level, but while there never was a future in nordic combined for girls, there have always been girls in nordic combined, for a while at least.         image        gyda westvold hansen of norway, left, signing an autograph in steamboat springs. at 16, she is one of the competitors who could help women&rsquo;s nordic combined become an olympic sport.   credit  joel reichenberger for the new york times       image        steamboat springs hosted two events as part of an 11-event continental cup series meant to raise the profile of nordic combined.   credit  joel reichenberger for the new york times        when boys in the sport became teenagers, they could start to dream of competing at a world cup event or even making it to the olympics. girls, however, had to start looking for something else to do.  “nordic combined was no. 1 for me, but all the coaches, whether they were cross-country coaches or ski jumping coaches, they just looked at me and said, ‘you have to choose,’” geraghty-moats said.  with no olympic future to dream of, many teenage girls focused on one side of the sport while others opted out of the lifestyle entirely.  those who lingered found diminishing returns. the competition geraghty-moats traveled across the country for in 2005, the premier event that season, had only six girls in it. smaller events often could not muster even the two needed to make a race.  “it would get boring,” meaghan reid of canada said. “i’d win canadian nationals every year because i was the only one in my age group. i just had to finish the race.”        f.i.s., the global governing body for skiing, has been trying to change that. the goal has been to create a wave of competitors ready for the big time. there have been international youth events since 2014. last season featured a test event at the nordic world junior ski championships, and this season will have a full event there, the first world championship ever awarded in the sport.  those events have drawn strong participation, often more than 30 athletes.            image     veronica gianmoena of italy, top left, and stefaniya nadymova of russia after a sprint to the finish in the 5k portion of the competition on dec. 14 in steamboat springs.   credit  joel reichenberger for the new york times         efforts to start a senior circuit have not gone as well. a continental cup series, the precursor to a world cup, was started last winter. geraghty-moats missed it with an injury. nineteen athletes showed up for four european events, but never more than 13 at a time.  to cap it all, the international olympic committee decided during the summer to leave women’s nordic combined off the program for the 2022 olympics. the next chance is 2026, an event so far out that it has not yet been awarded to a host city.  “would the sport have been ready for 2022? we’ll never know,” said lasse ottesen, the f.i.s. nordic combined race director. “it was a very aggressive goal from our side.”   he added that 2026 was the new goal, “and we will definitely be ready.”  the women’s nordic combined continental cup has returned this winter with a more robust schedule, with 11 events, including four earlier this month in the united states: two in steamboat springs and two in park city, utah.  the competitors came from nine nations and fit into two categories.  some, like veronica gianmoena of italy, 23, came back to nordic combined after years away. she competed until she was 14, giving it up when she qualified for the italian ski jumping team. she hurried back two years ago when the first continental cup events came on the horizon.        reid, from canada, is finishing her master’s degree and applying for medical school, nine years removed from nordic combined. she wanted to try an international event, however.  “i would have killed for this opportunity 10 years ago,” she said.  others, like gyda westvold hansen of norway and jenny nowak of germany, who are both 16, are arriving at the perfect time. they never had to decide how long to stick with a futureless sport. instead, they have been competing in youth events for several years.  their experience is evident. hansen placed second in both steamboat competitions and won once in park city. nowak won the junior worlds test event last season and was second in both park city events this month.  they are the leading edge of the wave organizers hoped to build. seven of the 14 athletes competing in steamboat springs were teenagers, including two from the united states: tess arnone, a 15-year-old who has long dreamed of nordic combined glory, and annika malacinski, 17, who was drawn to the sport by its new potential.  then there’s geraghty-moats.            image         credit  joel reichenberger for the new york times         a twisting road of injuries and tough decisions had her focusing on cross-country skiing, biathlon and ski jumping in different seasons. but now training with the ski jumping and the nordic combined teams with u.s.a. nordic, it all prepared her to fly far on a cold day and ski fast through a dark night in steamboat springs. she won all three continental cup events she entered this month in the united states, but the first stood out.  she coasted toward the finish line with her arms spread, taking in a moment she had wanted since she was 11 and in her first big event.        it was still more than 2,600 days to the 2026 olympic opening ceremony, but after waiting so long just to compete in her sport, she wasn’t counting.  “we’ve all chosen a path that isn’t the standard one, and maybe not even the recommended one, but we’re here because we love the sport,” geraghty-moats said.   “we don’t have the olympics as a carrot. we don’t have tons of sponsors or funding or even sometimes a team to train with. it’s amazing to be competing with women who love the sport this much.”       ',\n",
       " 'hong kong — as fighting raged across the battlefield in a video game called arena of valor, the announcers could barely contain their enthusiasm.  “that is going to be two kills for team thailand!” said caro wang, an announcer who was  calling a video game competition  this week at the  asian games  in indonesia. “make that three, actually.”  “chinese taipei counter-engaging!” added her fellow announcer, jeff chau, after a virtual character in a red cape shot an opponent with a bazooka-like gun. “getting the kill, getting the snare.”  competitive video gaming is an exhibition sport this week at the asian games — perhaps the largest international exposure yet for an e-sports industry that is said to be  worth nearly $1 billion . “e-sports” are scheduled to be upgraded to the status of a medal event at the next asian games, in 2022, and the international olympic committee has said it will consider eventually adding them to the olympics.        but the timing of the event — the same week that a gamer with a real weapon  shot and killed two people and himself at a video game tournament in florida  — is awkward because many games played by “e-athletes” revolve around violence.  “i think it is inevitable” that e-sports will become olympic events because of their soaring popularity, said samart benjamin assarasakorn, the executive secretary to the president of the  thailand e-sports federation . but he added that violence in games was an issue that needed to be “worked out.”  the term “e-sports” refers to video games that are played across a variety of digital platforms in competitive settings, including stadiums. global revenues for the industry were expected to reach $906 million this year, up more than 38 percent over 2017,  according to a report by newzoo , an amsterdam-based research firm. the report said china accounted for $164 million of the total, and north america for $345 million.  the 135 e-sports players at this week’s asian games represent 18 countries and were drawn from a 27-nation qualifying pool, according to the asian electronic sports federation, a co-organizer of the demonstration matches. ms. wang, the announcer, said the players were a mix of amateurs and professionals, some of whom have handsome corporate sponsorships.  “i’ve been longing to wear china’s national flag on the world stage since the first time i played  honor of kings  three years ago,” zhang yucheng, a professional who played for china this week, was quoted as saying in the beijing news on tuesday. he was referring to the chinese video game that arena of valor was adapted from.        the matches, in six separate video games, were being followed online by fans across the region. two days after the chinese national team defeated taiwan in the  arena of valor  finals, for example, the trending topic “#e-sports asian game” had more than 710 million clicks on sina weibo, a twitter-like social media platform.  “i’ve always believed that those who can be olympic champions not only have better physical bodies, but also smart brains,” one weibo user wrote.  alan hellawell, the group chief strategy officer for  sea , the singapore-based parent company of a firm that publishes arena of valor in taiwan and southeast asia, said the asian games matches were “another form of legitimacy” for e-sports in a part of the world where they are booming.            image     the finals of the league of legends e-sports tournament between south korea and china at the asian games in jakarta on wednesday.   credit  raminder pal singh/epa, via shutterstock         “e-sports is in many ways an everyman’s or everywoman’s game,” mr. hellawell said. “the only barrier to entry is being able to find a device, and it doesn’t even need to be your own.”  the international olympic committee helped organize a forum on e-sports in july in switzerland. among other questions, the committee  reported , the forum explored “the question of whether e-sports could be recognized as a sport,” as well as how they “could align with the olympic values, rules and regulations.”  despite the genre’s growing profile, even top players remain dogged by skepticism over whether they are real athletes.        mr. assarasakorn of the thai e-sports federation said a common problem is that casual video gamers are confused with “e-athletes,” some of whom have training regimens that include running and muscle-strengthening exercises. he added that physical training was linked with success in e-sports, and that playing video games had a physical dimension.  “even typing what i’m saying now, you’re engaging your core muscles,” he told this reporter.  but the prevalence of violence in e-sports competitions may be a steeper obstacle to overcome.  thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee,  said in april  that “killer games” or ones that promote “violence or any kind of discrimination” would never be suitable for olympic competition. “they would be contrary to our values and our principles,” he said.  it was unclear whether the six video games being played at the asian games would meet mr. bach’s definition of nonviolence. (the official  description  of arena of valor says the basic objectives include “killing enemies” and “destroying towers and the enemy base.”) the i.o.c. did not respond to emailed questions.  on wednesday, kenneth fok, the chief of the asian electronic sports federation, a governing body,  told reporters  that while sunday’s shooting in jacksonville, fla., was a tragedy, e-sports and video games were not to blame.  “i think it is a bigger issue of gun control and also the access to guns,” mr. fok said.  in interviews this week, people in the industry offered different views on whether it was feasible — or desirable — for e-sports to shed their violent ways in a bid to shine up for a possible olympic appearance.  some, like huang cheng hui, a professional player from china who competes under the nom de guerre lciop, said certain games could be toned down to make them olympic-friendly without dampening their competitive spirit.        “there are still a lot of games that aren’t so violent,” mr. huang, 23, the silver medalist this week in a video game called clash royale, added. (e-sports medals are not being counted toward the overall tally at the asian games.)  but ms. wang, the arena of valor announcer, said that choosing less-violent games for an olympic event would be a “disservice” to ones that feature shooting, in part because their violence is often rendered in cartoonish ways.  “they’re great e-sports to watch,” she said. “they require immense amounts of skill to make it to the top.”       ',\n",
       " 'in a rare move used only as a last resort, the united states olympic committee announced on monday that it was moving to strip u.s.a. gymnastics of its power as a national governing body, sending waves of relief through a sport struggling to right itself after a devastating sex abuse scandal.  sarah hirshland, chief executive of the u.s.o.c., said in a statement that her organization’s decision was “not a conclusion that we have come to easily.” by decertifying u.s.a.g., the olympic committee would be taking control of a national governing body on the grounds that the federation had proven incapable of running itself properly.  “this is a situation in which there are no perfect solutions,” hirshland said in the statement, which came just two days after the conclusion of the gymnastics world championships in doha, qatar.  in a letter to the gymnastics community, hirshland went on to say: “you deserve better,” and that the challenges facing the u.s.a. gymnastics “are simply more than it is capable of overcoming in its current form.”        u.s.a. gymnastics’s board of directors issued a statement as well, acknowledging that it had received a letter from the u.s.o.c. initiating the decertification process and that it was “evaluating the best path forward for our athletes, professional members, the organization and staff.”  “u.s.a. gymnastics’s board was seated in june 2018 and inherited an organization in crisis with significant challenges that were years in the making,” the statement said. “in the four months since, the board has done everything it could to move this organization towards a better future.” the board also added that it was searching for a new u.s.a.g. chief executive and that “substantial work remains” for the organization.  if u.s.a. gymnastics is decertified, it would be only the fourth time in recent years that the u.s.o.c. has officially wrested control from a national governing body. in the past, it has decertified team handball because of “a continued pattern of dysfunction,” and also took over the taekwondo federation because it had financial problems and failed to “effectively confront its problems.”  the u.s.o.c. even threatened to disband u.s.a. track and field simply because that organization’s board of directors was too big.  in this instance, the olympic committee has asked u.s.a. gymnastics to voluntarily hand over control of the federation in the wake of its handling of one of the biggest sex-abuse scandals in sports history. the organization failed to protect scores of athletes from lawrence g. nassar, the former longtime national team doctor who is now in prison serving what amounts to a life sentence for multiple charges of criminal sexual conduct. he was initially arrested in 2016, and more than 300 girls and women have accused him of molesting them under the guise of medical treatment.        rachael denhollander, a former gymnast who was the first to go public with accusations against nassar, said “it’s about time” the u.s.o.c. came to this decision.  “i just wish they would’ve taken this step two years ago when it became clear that u.s.a.g. couldn’t handle the situation,” she added. “none of this has been fair to the athletes.”  u.s.a. gymnastics is facing dozens of lawsuits involving plaintiffs who said nassar abused them. with that litigation looming, it has failed to secure a president and chief executive able to lead the sport out of this low point. the organization is in the process of looking for its fourth leader in less than two years.  steve penny, the federation’s longtime chief executive, resigned in march 2017 under pressure over the way he managed the nassar case, and was arrested last month on a federal charge of evidence tampering in one nassar investigation.  penny was succeeded by kerry perry, who was hired in december 2017, and subsequently forced out  in september  after promising congress that the organization was already working to be much better to its athletes. perry had hired mary lee tracy, a well-known coach and gym owner, for an elite development position even though tracy had continued to defend nassar after many women had publicly accused him of abuse.  last month, mary bono, the former congresswoman from california, resigned after just days as interim president and chief executive after being criticized for opposing nike’s support of colin kaepernick, the former n.f.l. quarterback known for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and social injustice.  amid this near-constant upheaval, jamie dantzscher, a 2000 olympic bronze medalist for the u.s., said the u.s.o.c. had significant work to do if it wants to save u.s.a. gymnastics.        dantzscher, who has said that nassar abused her, said the u.s.o.c. must focus its efforts on hiring the right leadership for u.s.a. gymnastics — leadership that “actually cares about children’s safety more than it cares about the dollar signs.” she said she was also hoping the u.s.o.c. would make wholesale changes to the gymnastics federation to help the sport move past this dark era.  “i would like to clean house and get them all out and kind of start over,” dantzscher said in a telephone interview. “i would definitely like to see a whole new system and new people.”  she noted that the u.s.o.c. should not escape criticism, as well, because it was made aware of abuse allegations against nassar more than a year before he was arrested. dantzscher said she was hoping congress would keep a close eye on the olympic committee as it tries to help u.s.a. gymnastics rebuild. congress is investigating how the nassar case and other sex abuse cases were able to occur in olympic sports.  it was not immediately clear how the u.s.o.c. would handle the operations of the gymnastics federation while a potentially lengthy decertification process unfolds. the u.s.o.c. has to appoint a review board, hold a hearing, wait for the review panel to issue a report, and then the u.s.o.c. board would hold a final vote on decertification.  in her letter to the gymnastics community on monday, she acknowledged the possibility that an entirely new entity could be created to carry out the many responsibilities that u.s.a gymnastics currently has. those include managing elite national teams, and certifying gyms and coaches.  “over time, gymnastics clubs around the country may become members of a new organization that lives up to the expectations of the athletes and those that support them, their parents included,” hirshland said in the letter.

       " 'in many ways, there has never been a better time to be a member of the united states women’s national hockey team.  two years after the players  threatened to boycott  the world championship tournament over pay equity, u.s.a. hockey, the national governing body, is paying them more than ever, about $71,000 each annually.  on the ice, the american women have continued to exceed the achievements of the men’s national team and won their second olympic gold medal in  a stirring final against canada .  members of the team have skated in the skills competition at n.h.l. all-star weekend and served as analysts for n.h.l. television broadcasts. participation in the sport among girls and women is  skyrocketing .        but halfway through the labor contract with u.s.a. hockey signed in march 2017, as the national team begins its pursuit of a fifth straight world championship in finland this week, its players wonder whether the future of their sport is as bright as the present. those concerns grew after the canadian women’s hockey league, one of two professional leagues in north america, announced sunday  it would fold in may .  although the american players negotiated gains in salary and travel and medical benefits two years ago, the “ groundbreaking support ” for girls and women’s hockey promised by u.s.a. hockey in the contract has been slow to develop. the women’s high performance advisory group created in the deal has been largely invisible. minimal promotion for the team and a lack of organizational diversity in u.s.a. hockey also raise concerns from players and female alumni that little has changed.  “people are drooling for women’s hockey,” forward kendall coyne schofield said in an interview late last year. “but the product we deliver isn’t being shown. there’s been a lot of lost opportunities, a lot of opportunities that haven’t been capitalized on.”            image     kendall coyne schofield, left, and hilary knight have complained about the lack of exposure the team had when its popularity was the highest after the olympics.   credit  jung yeon-je/agence france-presse — getty images         those opportunities included high-profile media appearances before the olympics like a national magazine feature, a major network documentary series and other live television offers, which u.s.a. hockey declined, according to three people with direct knowledge of those projects. after the olympics, some players were unaware that they were eligible for four-figure bonuses offered by hershey’s for winning the gold medal.        u.s.a. hockey’s executive director, pat kelleher, was not made available for an interview to discuss the women’s national team.  after the olympics, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, but players were frustrated that there were no plans for a post-olympic exhibition tour. in an interview late last year, forward hilary knight lamented that the team disappeared when its popularity was at its highest.  because of the talent disparity between north american teams and the rest of the world, there are  not many viable opponents for the americans , and canada’s cooperation is necessary. last month, the two nations finally staged a three-game exhibition series, with one game in the united states. an announced crowd of 9,048 fans attended the game in detroit, which was also broadcast live on nhl network.  but other avenues to increase exposure do not need canadian co-signs, like merchandising. nike, the official apparel supplier of u.s.a. hockey and a company that champions equality in advertisements, does not sell jerseys of american women’s players or products specifically featuring female players. neither does u.s.a. hockey’s online store.  coyne schofield, one of the players who has been featured by the n.h.l. since the olympics, is inundated with inquiries from parents about where they can buy apparel with her name. she has memorized a response with detailed instructions on how to purchase customized men’s items, even down to the six-week shipping time frame. that’s how knight obtained replicas of her jersey for her family.  “that alone is so degrading,” coyne schofield said. “there’s no reason why anybody shouldn’t be able to go on  usahockey.com  and buy a hilary knight jersey, my jersey. right now, women’s hockey is not accessible to consumers. it needs to be accessible in every fashion.”        nike, which  recently unveiled soccer kits  for the 2019 women’s world cup that for the first time were specifically designed for women’s teams, did not respond to requests to discuss its women’s hockey apparel.            image        kendall coyne schofield competed in the fastest skater competition during n.h.l. all-star weekend in january.   credit  ben margot/associated press         as with the jerseys, the american players handle much of their promotion themselves. despite repeated requests from athletes, u.s.a. hockey has not created social medial channels dedicated solely to the women’s team, as u.s. soccer has. olympians like coyne schofield and monique lamoureux-morando worked as analysts on nhl network and nbcsn. the players have lobbied the n.h.l. for more support for women’s hockey, particularly for its professionals, whose salaries range from $2,000 to $10,000.  the women’s high performance advisory group was supposed to be a conduit of influence for the players. over the past two years, u.s.a. hockey declined repeated requests to discuss the group.  the new york times confirmed the participation of at least five women in the group, including hockey executives and members of the 2018 olympic team. multiple people with knowledge of meetings said the group was stagnant in its first year and only recently began having meaningful conversations. one player said she was unsure if she was allowed to talk about the group.  in march, the n.h.l. and the n.h.l. players’ association  announced the formation of their own female hockey advisory committee  with the goal “to accelerate the growth” of hockey for girls and women in north america, and named 11 members, all women. they include michele amidon, a former director for women’s hockey at u.s.a. hockey, and several former members of the u.s. national women’s team.  but women’s representation remains lacking in u.s.a. hockey’s leadership.  of all american winter olympic governing sports bodies, u.s.a. hockey has the lowest percentage of women on its board of directors (17.58 percent) and is the worst at reaching its benchmark for female hires, according to the most recent data available from the united states olympic committee.  there are full-fledged councils within u.s.a. hockey devoted to youth, adult and junior hockey, but none specifically for girls and women. decisions related to girls’ and women’s hockey are administered by the youth council, which is led by a man and where only four of the 25 members are women. there are also no women on the organization’s marketing council.        proponents for u.s. women’s hockey have long struggled to have their voices heard. lynn olson became the first woman hired to work for u.s.a. hockey’s girls and women’s section back in 1988, but it served only as an advisory panel to the board of directors.  during her tenure, which ended in 2013, olson described u.s.a. hockey as being run like a “good old boys club.” she was sometimes denied funds to hold meetings for her panel, so she put up her own money. olson also said she tried to make the section a full-fledged council, which would provide more influence, writing up legislation that never passed.            image        the united states and canada played an exhibition game in detroit in february that drew more than 9,000 fans and was broadcast live on nhl network.   credit  gregory shamus/getty images         olson noted that more women wanted to be involved in u.s.a. hockey, but had a hard time getting elected to positions of power. “you need to change the minds of males in the room,” she said.  veteran leaders of the hockey team expressed faith that the culture could change under kelleher, who was named u.s.a. hockey’s executive director in april 2017. in recent months, he met with players in maine, chicago and michigan.  “we hadn’t had that in the past,” coyne schofield said. “for me, it was a huge first impression.”  the united states national women’s soccer team, an  inspiration for the hockey team  in its fight for equality, was so frustrated with the lack of progress on a number of issues that the players recently  filed a gender discrimination lawsuit  against its governing body, u.s. soccer.  knight said she did not yet foresee a repeat of the fraught 2017 negotiations that led to the boycott threat and a fracture between u.s.a. hockey and the women’s team that is still being repaired.        u.s.a. hockey seems to be aware of the need for more gender balance. don gould, chairman of the girls and women’s section, said at the federation’s annual meeting that the organizational culture must evolve to advance opportunities for girls and women, socially and in sport.  “this objective cannot be realized without first creating an environment that values them equally at every level,” gould said. “whether we work on the bench or in the boardroom, this is our first obligation.”  but nine of 10 members of u.s.a. hockey’s committee that nominates candidates to become officers of the organization are men.  “there are great people at the top that care about women’s hockey, but you absolutely don’t have the numbers to have a real change,” said angela ruggiero, one of the most accomplished american hockey players and a former member of the international olympic committee athletes’ commission. “we have an extremely long way to go.”       ',\n",
       " 'north and south korea agreed wednesday to pursue a joint bid to host the summer olympics in 2032.  the announcement came at a  summit meeting  in pyongyang, north korea’s capital, between president moon jae in of south korea and north korea’s leader, kim jong-un. the meeting also elicited a promise from mr. kim to  permanently dismantle some facilities  that produce fuel for nuclear warheads.  few details about the olympics proposal were released.  “we agreed to cooperate on a bid to jointly host the 2032 summer olympics,” was all mr. moon said in his statement.  it left undetermined issues like which countries would host which events, and how the closed society of north korea might handle an influx of international athletes, fans and news media.  last week, south korea’s sports minister, do jong-hwan, raised the prospect of a joint bid.  “it’s a proposal of hosting the events in seoul and pyongyang,” do said, in remarks  reported by the yonhap  news agency.        “the pyeongchang winter olympics showed the olympic values very well,” he said. “i hope peace in northeast asia can continue through sports.”  the international olympic committee is years away from picking a host for the 2032 games. the 2020 summer games will be held in tokyo, and last year the i.o.c.  awarded  the 2024 games to paris and the 2028 games to los angeles.  but the mere idea that the koreas might bid together suggested the olympics remain a powerful incentive to keep the countries, which are technically at war more than six decades on from the korean war, talking about peace.  in recent years the koreas have increased their sporting ties, including entering combined teams in some international events. north korea, in an unexpected breakthrough, sent a delegation of athletes, supporters and high-ranking officials to the winter games that south korea hosted in february in pyeongchang. athletes from the two koreas entered the stadium together for the opening ceremony, and competed together as part of a combined women’s hockey team.  mr. moon has been eager for improved relations with the north, offering increased economic cooperation in exchange for promises by the north to denuclearize.        seoul previously hosted the summer olympics in 1988. there were plans at both the 1988 and 2018 games to stage some events in north korea, but in both cases those plans fell through.  the decision on the host for 2032 would not normally be made until 2025. germany has expressed interest in hosting the games in a dozen cities centered around düsseldorf. brisbane, australia, also has been mentioned as a candidate, as have india, south africa and indonesia, though campaigning has not yet begun in earnest.  the i.o.c. has in recent years sought to make the olympics a more feasible undertaking for more cities by simplifying the bidding process for the games, streamlining events and being open to multinational games.  it has been a boom time for the olympics in asia, with three consecutive games held there: pyeongchang in 2018, tokyo in 2020, and beijing — the summer games host in 2008 — for the winter games in 2022.

       " 'in the summer of 1968, a roiling year of war, assassination and political and racial tension, i turned 14 in the cajun town of eunice, la. schools would not fully integrate until a year later, after man walked on the moon. so naïve was i as a boy, so complete and unquestioned was segregation, i thought the sign at the laundromat that said, “whites only,” referred to the color of clothing.  in 1968, i was also first drawn irresistibly to the olympics, an event i have now covered 14 times: bob beamon launched a magnificently unbound long jump at the summer games in mexico city. and most startling to a sheltered white teenager in the south, the 200-meter sprinters  tommie smith  and john carlos raised gloved fists on the medal stand during the playing of “the star-spangled banner” to protest the treatment of black americans.  oct. 16 is the 50th anniversary of what is probably the most indelible image of sports activism of the last half-century. it’s the first thing i thought of upon hearing about nike’s ad campaign with colin kaepernick, the quarterback who lost his n.f.l. career after kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial and social injustice.  kaepernick is a direct activist descendant of smith and carlos, unyielding in his conviction, fully understanding of risk and sacrifice and the power and dignity of  silent gesture . and he knows something they did not a half-century ago, that history can act as sandpaper, smoothing abrasive denunciation into burnished acceptance.        while speaking at notre dame last spring, carlos called kaepernick “ my hero .” the scuff of criticism that kaepernick was unpatriotic, disrespectful to the flag and the military, carlos predicted, would be buffed and polished until he was more widely celebrated as righteous and courageous for calling attention to income equality and police brutality.            image     colin kaepernick, center, started kneeling during the national anthem to raise awareness of racial and social injustice. he has been out of the n.f.l. for more than a year.   credit  thearon w. henderson/getty images         last year, on his website,  carlos wrote  that kaepernick would one day be compared favorably to martin luther king jr., malcolm x and rosa parks, praising him as “one of the key fruits of our labor.”  carlos, 73, a native of harlem who said he danced outside the savoy ballroom with boyhood friends and was rewarded with silver dollars from  fred astaire , speaks from hard-earned experience. after the mexico city protest, he and smith were kicked out of those olympics and infamously  called “black-skinned storm troopers”  by brent musburger, then a chicago columnist. both athletes received death threats. the f.b.i. monitored them for years.  both played professional football, briefly, forgetfully, and struggled at times to find work. smith worked at a carwash. carlos told the boston globe that he could not afford the electric bill and  burned furniture in the fireplace  to keep his family warm. his marriage broke up and his first wife, kim, committed suicide in 1977. decades later, he said he still felt haunted.        public perception of smith and carlos began to change by the 1980s. both became emissaries for the 1984 summer olympics in los angeles and have been inducted into the united states track and field hall of fame. in 2005, a 23-foot statue depicting the mexico city protest was  unveiled at san jose state , their alma mater.  smith, 74, a son of texas sharecroppers, earned a master’s degree in sociology and, like carlos, settled into a career of coaching, teaching, counseling. while their protest is often characterized as a black power salute, smith  described it to smithsonian  magazine in 2008 as “a cry for freedom and for human rights. we had to be seen because we couldn’t be heard.”  the most direct connection between smith and carlos and kaepernick is harry edwards, a sociologist who was a mentor to smith and carlos at san jose state in 1968 and has been a longtime adviser to the san francisco 49ers, whom kaepernick led to the super bowl during the 2012 season. edwards calls kaepernick the “muhammad ali of his generation.”            image        smith won the 200-meter final ahead of carlos, far left, at the 1968 summer olympics.   credit  agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         “you don’t make this sacrifice, pay this price, unless you love this country,” edwards said of smith and carlos and kaepernick. “what they are saying is, ‘we’re better than this as americans.’ ”  smith and carlos and kaepernick were empowered by separate but broad-based social movements, the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the black lives matter movement of today. all three athletes brilliantly understood the capacity of silent gestures conveyed through the rituals of sport, said douglas hartmann, chairman of the sociology department at the university of minnesota. kaepernick’s kneeling during the anthem, he said, “is taking a gesture that is religious in overtones, very spiritual almost.” (a military veteran and former n.f.l. player suggested to kaepernick that he not sit but kneel, as is done for fallen soldiers.)  there are differences, too, between the protests then and now. kaepernick has the corporate backing of nike, the reach of social media, public support from white athletes and coaches and belongs to a generation of athletes more broadly willing to use their platforms to address social issues, hartmann said.        “in 1968, it was a small sample of elite olympic athletes who were the only ones who really dared to think about boycotts or protests; now you’ve got high school teams taking a knee,” said hartmann, the author of “race, culture and the revolt of the black athlete: the 1968 olympic protests and their aftermath.”  i was unable to reach smith or carlos through telephone and email messages. so i called another person who was at estadio olímpico in mexico city on oct. 16, 1968. dixie saucier was then a physical education teacher and the girls’ basketball coach at eunice high school in my hometown. she and her daughter, adele smith, then a student, attended the games as spectators and brought home posters that were placed in the gym.  still robust enough at 91 to play an occasional round of golf, saucier recalled the crowd growing impatient at the delay caused by the medal ceremony after the 200 meters. but of the protest by smith and carlos, she said: “it took guts. they probably knew what was going to happen to them.”       ',\n",
       " 'the united states olympic committee was made aware of sexual abuse in gymnastics more than two decades before the lawrence g. nassar molestation scandal shook the sport to its core, according to court documents filed wednesday in a california federal court.  kathy scanlan, the president of u.s.a. gymnastics from 1994 to 1998, said in a sworn statement last month that she had notified the u.s.o.c. of the sexual abuse problem soon after she took charge of the organization. the u.s.o.c.’s response, she said, was to discourage her from using the federation’s established protocol for investigating and disciplining its professional members who were accused of sexual abuse. she said that she had gone ahead and pursued cases the accused anyway.  “u.s.o.c.’s challenge to u.s.a.g. disciplining professional members in this fashion (specifically impeding the ability to ban, suspend or investigate a member) would have inhibited me from adequately protecting minor members,” scanlan said in her statement, which was part of hundreds of pages of documents filed wednesday in a lawsuit that aly raisman, the two-time olympian, has filed. raisman is suing nassar, who was the national team doctor; the u.s.o.c.; u.s.a. gymnastics; and other defendants.  scanlan’s testimony highlighted the fact that the federation and the u.s.o.c. had battled for years over how to handle sexual abuse cases. that conflict appears to have lasted until at least 1999, when scanlan’s successor, bob colarossi, confronted the u.s.o.c. in a letter that was unsealed in 2017 as part of another sex abuse case in the sport.        colarossi wrote that the olympic committee had demonstrated an “apparent indifference to the welfare of young children” and that committee members had repeatedly advised responding to reports of abuse by conducting “bare-bones telephonic hearings immediately upon receipt of a sexual abuse complaint.” colarossi said that was not enough to protect young athletes.  on wednesday, patrick sandusky, a spokesman for the u.s.o.c., declined to comment until he had had more time to look into the matter.  steve penny, who took over as president and chief executive of the federation after colarossi left, has also been accused of not doing enough to protect young athletes. he waited five weeks to contact the f.b.i. after learning that gymnasts had complained of nassar’s inappropriate touching.  penny, who resigned in march 2017, also worried about the federation’s image as the nassar case ensued and went out of his way to become close with investigators. among other things the new york times reported last month, he had discussed the possibility of a top security job at the u.s.o.c. with an f.b.i. agent who investigated the nassar case. nassar is now serving decades in prison on charges of criminal sexual misconduct and possession of child pornography.  an email included in wednesday’s court filings elaborated on penny’s efforts on behalf of the agent. in the email to larry buendorf, who was then the chief security officer for the u.s.o.c., penny wrote, “i found a great guy who might be the perfect fit for your role when you decide to leave.”        buendorf was planning to retire in 2018, and the email was sent in july 2016. that “great guy,” penny wrote, was jay abbott, the special agent in charge of the f.b.i.’s field office in indianapolis.  when asked about the email, penny’s lawyer, edith r. matthai, said that penny had done nothing wrong when he discussed the u.s.o.c. job in connection with abbott and that there had been no conflict of interest.  “this whole idea that something was done to influence something is just insane,” matthai said wednesday in a telephone interview. “at the time of the email, mr. abbott’s office was no longer involved in the investigation of nassar because it had been transferred to the u.s. attorney’s office and the f.b.i. in detroit.”  she called penny’s mention of the security job to abbott, and his discussion with buendorf about it, “ordinary networking that happens in ordinary businesses on a daily basis.”  penny was arrested last month on a felony charge of evidence tampering in a texas investigation into nassar. he is accused of ordering the removal of documents from the national team training center north of houston, where nassar often worked and where many of his victims have said they were assaulted. at the time of penny’s arrest, texas prosecutors said they did not know where the documents were or if they had been destroyed.  penny pleaded not guilty, and u.s.a. gymnastics subsequently said it had found documents at its indianapolis headquarters that might be the ones removed from the ranch.  in a deposition that was among the documents filed wednesday, rhonda faehn, the former vice president for the federation’s women’s program, said that amy white, the former national teams manager, told her that she had removed medical records from the training center in november 2016, flown with them to indianapolis and delivered them to penny. a deposition from white was included in the documents; she repeatedly asserted her fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.

       " 'duluth, minn. — the night he won gold at the winter olympics in february, tyler george slept with the medal next to his pillow. he wanted to make sure it would still be there in the morning.  nearly a year later, he still has barely let the medal out of sight, in large part because he has not been allowed to let it out of sight.  “i know that if i show up without that thing, they’ll send me home,” george said.  this is what happens when you are part of the first american men’s curling team to win an olympic gold medal.  as invited guests at hockey games, golf tournaments and parades across the country, the members of the team have found that just about everyone wants a look at those medals. george and his four teammates — john shuster, john landsteiner, matt hamilton and joe polo — have appeared at award shows, state fairs, countless learn-to-curl events and  at least one broadway production  (“the play that goes wrong”). they have given pep talks to marathoners and delivered commencement speeches to high school students. they have sung karaoke with jimmy fallon and  blown the gjallarhorn  at a minnesota vikings game.        their medals have been kissed by dozens, caressed by hundreds and worn by thousands — literally thousands, they say. and forget about all the selfies. between stops, the members of the team have gone so far as to bathe the faded ribbons from which the medals dangle.  “but it doesn’t bring that blue back,” shuster, 36, said with a trace of resignation.  they did not expect their victory tour to last quite so long, not that they are complaining. but there was something charming and inspiring about their olympic experience, which they capped with victories against canada and sweden to clinch the united states’ first gold in curling, the ice sport played with brooms and smooth granite rocks.  and so the invitations keep coming — as long as they remember to bring their medals with them.            image     tyler george during the gold medal game against sweden.   credit  doug mills/the new york times             image        the american men had never won gold in curling.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “i had a feeling that it would be crazy,” george said, “but it’s so far beyond what any of us could have imagined.”        how crazy?  hamilton’s distinctive bushy mustache was endorsed by remington after the olympics.  “i’m on a box, which is pretty neat,” he said.  hamilton, 26, said he believed the team’s everyman nature was a factor in its appeal. as he put it, “we’re not these  chiseled gods .”  landsteiner, 28, wonders if their medals have been the most widely traveled and heavily handled of any from the pyeongchang games. among the luminaries who have tried them on:  aaron rodgers , the quarterback of the green bay packers;  nick faldo , the three-time masters winner; and  alfonso ribeiro , the actor best known for his role as carlton banks on “the fresh prince of bel-air.”  the team became a big story at the olympics after it bounced back from a slow start to defeat a series of curling behemoths in the medal round. by the time the team  staged its upset for gold , it was the middle of the night back home in minnesota, where george grew up learning the game at the  duluth curling club .  sammy perrella, a longtime friend and the proprietor of sammy’s pizza, watched the final on television with friends — “and i was driving that night, so i was on my best behavior,” he said — before he migrated to george’s parents’ house, which became party central after someone made a celebratory pit stop at the liquor store that tyler runs with his father, tom.  “all of a sudden about 30 people show up with all this booze,” perrella said. “it went until like 10 in the morning. i was wrecked for two days!”            image        u.s. olympic gold medalists in curling john landsteiner, matt hamilton, joe polo and tyler george, left to right, demonstrate their sport on the floor of the new york stock exchange.   credit  richard drew/associated press         back in south korea, george and his teammates got an immediate sense that their lives had changed forever when rick patzke, the chief executive of u.s.a. curling, handed them his cellphone as they were leaving the venue: it was dave grohl, the lead singer of the foo fighters, who had reached out through a mutual connection to offer his congratulations.        “i remember thinking, ‘really? is this how it’s going to be?’” patzke said.  in a word: yes.  after the olympics, the team members made the difficult decision to pass on an opportunity to defend their national championship at a tournament in north dakota. they went to new york instead, where they appeared on “the tonight show” and rang the opening bell at the new york stock exchange.  “we looked around, like, ‘well, we could be in fargo right now,’” george said.  at the  minnesota twins’ home opener in april , each member of the team threw out a ceremonial first pitch. hamilton rolled his toward home plate, as if he were curling. george, a former all-conference pitcher in high school, decided to test out the old wing and uncorked a wild throw that whizzed past the catcher.  “knew i was in trouble as soon as i released it,” george said. “damn near killed that guy.”            image        george, center, during a rare visit home at the duluth curling club. he jokes that his apartment is merely a storage facility where he occasionally sleeps.   credit  tim gruber for the new york times         he got a redo a few weeks later when the omaha storm chasers, the triple-a affiliate of the kansas city royals, invited them to throw out another batch of first pitches.  “i think i bounced that one,” george said, “but at least i didn’t kill anybody.”  while golfing in the bmw charity pro-am in may, hamilton and shuster broke out their gold medals to use as ball markers before putts, though shuster was the only one who was heckled.  “awfully humble, aren’t we?” a woman shouted from the gallery.  but that sort of reaction has been the exception. through all their experiences — meeting jack nicklaus as special guests at a golf tournament in ohio, dropping pucks at n.h.l. games, riding on the curling float at the national cherry festival — the team members have found that their gold medals have a gravitational pull all their own.        “when you hand it to an adult for a couple seconds, they’re like a child again,” hamilton said. “they’re captivated by it.”  george said he enjoyed being able to share it with so many people, and in so many unconventional ways.  “it is the world’s greatest coaster,” he said.  george and his teammates often receive appearance fees — they need to make a living, after all — but hamilton said he thought their success at the olympics would have generated more revenue from mainstream sponsors. curling, however, remains a fringe sport in most of the united states, despite their best efforts. and the process of negotiating a movie deal — another big aspiration — has been fraught with challenges, though they are optimistic that their story could be coming (someday) to a big screen near you.  “it’s a learning process,” hamilton said. “we’ve tried to surround ourselves with people who know what they’re doing.”            image        a calendar from 2013 in tyler george’s apartment and a big head cutout of george at the duluth curling club.   credit  photographs by tim gruber for the new york times         george announced in may that he was stepping away from competition, citing fatigue. he actually had felt burned out a couple of years ago, he said, but the olympics were an unfulfilled goal. he now travels the globe as an ambassador for u.s.a. curling.  “we’ve never seen this type of enthusiasm from people who want to learn more about the sport,” he said. “it’s been amazing to see.”        chris plys replaced george on the team, which has resumed its competitive schedule in earnest. plys, who did not compete at the olympics, used to feel guilty when fans would congratulate him for winning gold, because he did not actually win anything. so he would correct them. but it got to be too much.  “i’ve stopped explaining to them that i wasn’t on the team,” plys said. “i’m like, ‘thanks! the olympic village was great! can’t eat any more bulgogi!’”  as for george, he does not spend much time in his apartment in duluth these days. he thinks of it as more of a storage facility where he occasionally sleeps when he is not on the road with his medal. he still has a cat calendar from 2013 up on the wall near his kitchen. a congratulatory letter from vice president mike pence sits atop a pile of mail.  on occasion, george thinks back to the night that changed his life: the team’s 10-7 victory over sweden at gangneung curling centre. during the match itself, george did not allow himself to entertain the dream of winning gold until it was practically assured.  “because it would have been too much pressure if we’d thought about what was ahead of us — the places we’d go and the people we’d meet,” he said. “none of us had any idea.”       ',\n",
       " 'aston, pa. — the day she covered every mirror in her new apartment because she could not stand the sight of herself anymore was a red flag.  but no one was around to register it.   and gracie gold, a figure skater once on the cusp of olympic stardom, was in no shape to help herself.   holed up in a detroit suburb, she kept her lights off so often, she said, that the electric bill one month was less than $20. she slept as much as 24 hours at a time, then stayed awake for three nights straight.  a good day was when she managed to brush her teeth and her hair.  her dream of an olympic gold medal? that had evaporated long ago, during her slow boil of a meltdown that she was struggling to keep a lid on.        in 2014, gold was a charismatic teenage prodigy, hailed as an athletic grace kelly because of her tight blond bun, bright red lipstick and regal bearing, her personality so sparkling it sometimes blinded people to the fact that she had not won an individual olympic medal.            image     gracie gold in january 2014, after winning her first national championship. the victory secured an olympic berth for gold, who finished fourth in singles at the winter games in sochi, russia, a month later.   credit  matthew stockman/getty images         three years later, in the dark of a michigan winter, gold felt her world closing in. she was hiding from her family, gorging on forbidden food and, with the next olympics less than a year out, unwilling — or unable — some days to summon even the energy required to drive to the practice rink less than 15 minutes away.  on occasion, gold said, revealing the depths of her mental illness for the first time, she imagined taking her life and nobody finding her body until the landlord came to collect overdue rent.  “i was suicidal for months,” gold said, adding, “if i had just continued the way i was in detroit, i’d probably be dead.”        this week the top figure skaters in the country have gathered in detroit for the national championships, and gold had planned to be among them, plotting the first chapter of her sequel. but she is not back. not yet.  as gold has discovered, mental health is a slippery slope, and she is still trying to find her footing.            image        gold changing into her skates at the iceworks.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         athletes are opening up about depression  until gold’s life began to unravel, she couldn’t comprehend mental illness. “i’d hear someone say, ‘i’m so depressed,’ and i’d think, ‘tough it out,’” she said.  that attitude is typical of elite athletes, said caroline silby, a sports psychologist who was a national-caliber skater. she has not treated gold, but has worked with prodigies like her.  “some of it is predestined,” silby said. “the dna is such that these individuals would be faced with these issues regardless of their olympic prowess. some of it is developed through habits and practices that feed the athletic quest for excellence but drive these individuals further away from being healthy, productive non-athletes.”        the olympic swimming great  michael phelps , the n.b.a. all-star  demar derozan  and the champion skier  lindsey vonn  are among those who have opened up in recent years about their struggles with depression.           seeking answers, michael phelps finds himself  june 24, 2016            gold, 23, decided last fall that she was ready to talk publicly about her ordeal, including an unhealthy relationship with food that, at her lowest point, led to an extreme weight gain. she sat for a series of interviews, displaying her wry sense of humor but very little skin, wearing baggy, long-sleeve sweatshirts and jackets that camouflaged her physique.  gold had lost more than half the extra weight but was too self-conscious, she said, to wear anything as revealing as a tank top or shorts.  the place where gold feels most at ease is the ice. she returned to it nine months ago, armed with new insights, coping mechanisms and a revamped support team that she hopes will help her better navigate the olympic ambitions that she never completely abandoned, even at her nadir.            image        gold decided last fall that she was ready to talk publicly about her ordeal. being an elite athlete, she said, meant pushing \"past the border of being normal and into the realm of insanity.”   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         to secure her eligibility for the national championships, gold entered a high-level event in moscow last fall against her coach’s recommendation. whether piecing together a program or her life, gold is drawn to dramatic narratives, and this one was particularly irresistible: detroit, where her collapse accelerated, would serve as a backdrop for her comeback.  but gold wasn’t ready.  she withdrew from nationals two weeks before she was to skate. her performance in moscow contributed to the decision. with less than seven months of consistent training behind her, she delivered a short program so ragged that she pulled out of the competition before the long program.        gold also realized that she did not relish the idea of returning to michigan. she is so haunted by memories of her time there that, she said, she rerouted a december trip to california to visit her mother and twin sister because her original itinerary required her to fly through detroit.  though it was there, in that stygian apartment, that she bottomed out, michigan was not where her problems began.  gold and her twin, carly, were born 40 minutes apart on aug. 17, 1995, and her family would later say it was only natural that gracie led the way out of the womb. throughout their childhood, she was fixated on being first, and flawless.  in the classroom, she would furiously, and tearfully, erase an entire sentence if she misspelled a single word. by second grade, she had found an outlet for her compulsiveness, taking formal skating lessons at a rink near the family home in springfield, mo.  carly followed her into the sport a few months later and did well, but never rivaled her sister. unlike gracie, she was wired more for fun than for perfection.  “she didn’t cross those lines that needed to be crossed to be an elite athlete,” gracie said of her twin. “she didn’t push past the border of being normal and into the realm of insanity.”            image        gold faltered in the only competition of her comeback, a grand prix event in moscow in november. the performance contributed to her decision to withdraw from this week\\'s national championships in detroit.   credit  maxim shemetov/reuters         gold’s skating ambitions led to several moves around the country over a decade. through her teens, she was accompanied everywhere by her sister and her mother, denise, a retired emergency room nurse. the twins’ skating schedules consumed denise’s life and left their father, carl, an anesthesiologist who had stayed put, a weekend parent financing his children’s nascent careers.  “i remember when we were in illinois, a sports psychologist saying, ‘can’t you just go to another coach in the area?’” gold’s mother said. “and i said: ‘no, skating’s not like that. in the whole world there’s only a few coaches that are world-class caliber.”  by the time gold came along, u.s. figure skating — which had produced an unbroken string of olympic medalists in the women’s competition, including five champions, from 1968 to 2006 —    was mired in a drought, and the sport’s popularity stateside was on the wane.  gold was seen as someone who could reverse america’s fortunes, a personality in the mold of kelly, the hollywood star turned royal princess. gold never saw herself that way, but the comparison sounded compelling, and soon she was reflecting back what others saw, describing kelly in interviews as her style icon.  “i almost created this other person,” gold said, adding: “i wanted to be the most flawless, angelic, plastic, barbie-doll-face human who just says all the right things and does all the right things and is sterling. and people just don’t like her because she’s so perfect.”  gold&#x27;s battle with food begins  until she was well into her teenage years, gold said, she didn’t fixate on her weight and never counted calories. she would routinely chug a carton of chocolate milk before practice without a second thought, then promptly burn it off her still-growing frame.  then one day she weighed herself in front of a coach, a common practice, and the scale read 124 pounds. “that’s a big number,” she remembered the coach saying.        stung by the remark, gold searched the internet for weight-loss tips. she stumbled onto a website on which people, primarily young women, shared strategies for extreme weight control. in one post, someone wrote about consuming 200 to 400 calories a day. gold felt her competitiveness shift into high gear.            image        gold competing at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia, where she established herself as a possible favorite for the 2018 games.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         “it all started off with me being dramatic and testing the waters,” gold said, “like i wonder if i could do this.”  she cut her food intake from roughly 2,000 calories a day to a few hundred, ignoring her mother’s warnings that there was no “magic diet” and subsisting many days on meals of one tomato and several cups of coffee.  “the more weight i lost, the quicker and faster i felt on the ice,” gold said. “it was win-win, because i was skating better and people were saying, ‘you look amazing.’”   gold’s mother thought her daughter was becoming too thin, and she remembered urging gracie to eat more in the lead-up to the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia.  “that was a nervy situation,” denise gold said.  gold said she weighed 118 pounds when, in quick succession, she won her first national title, helped the united states to a bronze in the team event in sochi and  finished fourth in the women’s singles  competition.        the next two years were a blur of fashion shoots and celebrity elbow rubbing with the likes of the pop singer taylor swift. then came the 2016 world figure skating championships in boston. gold entered the competition fresh off winning her second national title and seemed poised to become the first american woman in a decade to win a singles medal at the event.  but after finishing first in the short program, gold faltered on her opening jump sequence in the free skate and tumbled to fourth, two spots behind another american, ashley wagner, who skated exquisitely.  gold was devastated.  “it wasn’t just her pain,” denise gold said of what fed her daughter’s crushing disappointment. “it was her family’s pain. it was her agent’s pain. it was the country’s pain. it was that she was letting everyone down.”  within months, gold’s body, and her psyche, had begun to deteriorate. in the summer of 2016, she arrived in colorado springs for one of u.s. figure skating’s regular monitoring sessions for elite skaters — something of a training camp, if you will — with an extra 20 pounds on her 5-foot-5 frame and a glower almost perpetually on her face.  gold was depressed, and her deteriorating relationship with food now involved binge-purge cycles. her private struggles became immediately clear to wagner, her rival, who said recently, “there was just no one home, and that was a scary thing to see.”  wagner alerted a skating official that gold seemed unwell and needed help. sam auxier, the president of u.s. figure skating at the time, said the association, which makes licensed psychologists and other specialists available to athletes dealing with mental health problems, had acted promptly. but attempts to assist gold, he said, went nowhere.            image        gracie gold, left, and ashley wagner in

matthew stockman/getty images         “i don’t know if being more forceful with gracie would have worked,” auxier said, “just because she was in such denial.”  in retrospect, gold said, she should have taken time off in 2016. but with another olympics on the horizon, she tried to stay the course.  “you want people to see your pain so they see you need help,” gold said, “but you don’t want to ask for help. so you live in this kind of terrible limbo.”           talent. a football scholarship. then crushing depression.  nov. 15, 2018            gold’s facade crumbled entirely at another colorado springs monitoring session in the summer of 2017.  out of shape after isolating herself in michigan, gold took the ice looking like the grim reaper, wearing a hoodie and carrying 50 extra pounds.  her spins sputtered and her jumps, long considered spectacular, landed with a thud.  perhaps worse than the weight gain was what she had lost. gold’s smile, one as dazzling as any jump or spin, no longer reached the corners of her mouth, much less the upper reaches of the arena.        when the judges delivered their critiques, some could not hold back tears. gold interpreted their comments as accusations. “and that’s when i snapped,” she said.  she remembers sobbing, cursing and at one point screaming, “can’t anybody see the cry for help that is my existence right now?”  one of the judges confirmed gold’s account of that day. two members of the camp’s support staff soon approached gold, persuading her to delay her career and seek treatment. within a month, she entered an inpatient program for eating disorders, its cost covered by u.s. figure skating.  though initially skeptical about entering the meadows, a treatment center in arizona, gold quickly embraced the experience, she said, “because i thought it literally can’t get any worse or i’m going to die, and i want to live.”  gold issued a statement that she was taking time off from her sport. then she disappeared.  “i just dropped off the face of the earth for 45 days,” she said. “it was liberating.”  after treatment, gold gravitated back to skating            image        gold before her long program at the 2016 world championships in boston. in retrospect, gold said, she should  have taken time off that year.    credit  maddie meyer/getty images         after a year in a fog of depression, gold welcomed the structure of a daily schedule that stretched from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. she received intensive therapy, including sessions with her parents. she became estranged from them at about the time  her father’s medical license   was suspended  after state regulators said h e had stolen prescription drugs for personal use.         these days gold is on better terms with her family. she received a prozac prescription at the meadows, but she said she had weaned herself off it. and she comes to the rink in any kind of weather wearing rimless orange sunglasses, which give her a brighter outlook.  gold gravitated back to skating because she sought the kind of structure that had grounded her during treatment. last spring, she moved to the philadelphia area for a fresh start with a new coach, vincent restencourt, who earned her trust by insisting that she gradually reverse her weight gain. he insists on dining with gold at least once a week, and at their first meal together he coaxed her into eating at least half a hamburger, emphasizing that she should not starve herself back into shape.  since june, gold has lost more than 30 pounds, the result of a healthier combination of foods, she said, not any fad diet.  she gives skating lessons to young children and adults, trains alongside teenagers and wonders what they must be thinking.  “when i was their age,” gold said, “i never had a semiretired, mentally ill olympian come to my rink.”  the comeback feels a lot like starting from scratch. the first time gold executed a clean triple lutz, she felt an immense sense of accomplishment. “you forget how magical those moments are,” she said.  whenever gold returns to competition, she will have a new long program, the one she planned to unveil in detroit. it is set to sara bareilles’s “ she used to be mine ,” a song that she found in her mother’s playlist.        as gold moves forward with her life, the lyrics remind her of why she needed to step back: “she is hard on herself. she is broken and won’t ask for help. she is messy, but she’s kind. she is lonely most of the time.”            image         “you forget how magical those moments are,” gold said of landing a clean jump during her comeback.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times        ',\n",
       " 'denis ten, an olympic bronze medalist in men’s figure skating in 2014, died on thursday at age 25 after being stabbed in almaty, kazakhstan.  ten was taken to the hospital after the attack and died a few hours later.  russian and kazakh news media reported  that two men had been trying to steal mirrors from ten’s car. ten lost a significant amount of blood, and doctors  said    cpr was administered  for two hours, but in vain.  “denis ten caught two unidentified persons trying to steal mirrors from his car,”  the almaty department of internal affairs said . “as a result of a brawl, citizen denis ten was stabbed. an investigation has been initiated; measures are being taken to identify and detain suspects.”  born in almaty, ten was part of kazakhstan’s korean minority. he moved to moscow to train at a higher level at age 10, then to southern california to work with the top american coach frank carroll.        he won a surprise silver medal at the world championships in 2013, then a bronze at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia.  his olympic season had been disrupted by an infection, and he finished ninth in the short program. but skating to shostakovich in the free skate, he opened with a quad toe loop, jumped higher than many of his opponents, made few errors, and  pulled himself up to third .  this year he had hoped to do well in the olympics in south korea, his ancestral home. but hampered by ankle, back and hip injuries, he placed 27th.  “the way his blade touches the ice and the way he moves his body through space on the ice is highly individual,” lori nichol, a choreographer who worked with him,  said in 2015 . “and his passion is not just throwaway passion. it’s this really deep, profound passion, and when he lets it out, i’ve been reduced to tears in practice sometimes because, oh my god, i get blown away. i’ve worked at a high level and never seen anyone like it.”         ',\n",
       " 'vaduz, liechtenstein — balloons still bobbed on the stairway, more than two weeks after the 105th birthday celebration for baron eduard von falz-fein. he attributed his longevity to the succor of honey and ovaltine. still, his body had become a husk, but not his mind. it whirred and clicked like the monitor at his bedside.  “where is your recorder?” the baron asked me. “be sure it is on.”  i went to see him last week because of a mix-up. the baron had been erroneously considered by some researchers and olympic officials as the oldest living winter olympian. turns out, it was a case of mistaken identity. it was just another extravagant twist in a life full of them. and i wanted to hear more.  he agreed to tell — for the last time, he insisted — his life story, which included bringing olympic sports to the principality of liechtenstein, which connects switzerland and austria like a hyphen. with a population of less than 38,000, it is the smallest country to win an olympic medal. there have been nine, all in alpine skiing, and there are hopes that the 2018 winter games in south korea will bring liechtenstein’s first podium finish in three decades.  it was the baron’s idea, in 1934, to start an olympic committee in liechtenstein. this was not yet 40 years after the modern games were founded on the clashing, upper-class sensibilities of noble competition, amateurism and exclusion of women.        the baron had lived an aristocratic life through the end of the austro-hungarian empire, two world wars and the russian revolution. he was a patron of the arts and had sat as a reporter in the olympic stadium in berlin not so far from hitler. and he wanted to talk about it.  it was nearly 2 p.m. on a cloudy afternoon. he was not in a hurry.  “at 7 o’clock we will say goodbye,” the baron said.  after an hour, his caretaker intervened. he needed rest, doctor’s orders. still, the baron had so many stories to tell: how he found and promoted the country’s first two olympic skiers. and tweaked the design of liechtenstein’s national flag. and attended 16 winter and summer games as a sportswriter, official and coach.  there were other stories he did not have time for that day, that others would tell for him: his birth on sept. 14, 1912, to a wealthy family in what is now the grassy steppe of ukraine. his family’s nature preserve of zebras, camels and ostriches, which he called “the world’s largest zoo.” the family’s acquaintance with the romanovs, the dynasty that ruled russia for more than 300 years. the message sent to a cousin and literary matchmaker, vladimir nabokov, to find the baron a wife.  the baron was never an olympic athlete. he was never president of the liechtenstein olympic committee. but he supported the games with his money and with such enthusiasm that, in the telling of the country’s olympic officials, the baron piled liechtenstein’s team for the 1956 winter games into his luxury car and drove it to the competition in cortina d’ampezzo, italy.        “i think that’s really funny to drive to the olympics in a rolls-royce or something,” said beat wachter, secretary general of the liechtenstein olympic committee. that frivolity aside, he added, “the baron is maybe the most important figure in our olympic history.”            image     pages from the baron&rsquo;s autobiography, &ldquo;baron von falz-fein: a russian aristocrat in liechtenstein.&rdquo; he was born in russia, and his family fled to germany, france, switzerland, liechtenstein and the united states after the revolution in 1917.        on this october afternoon, the baron lay in his bed wearing blue pajamas, his hair wavy and long in the back, his eyes sharp, his voice thin but eager. he was surrounded by paintings and photographs and a medal he had received in february from the international olympic committee.  a newspaper lay on the floor near his bed. research for his autobiography, published in multiple languages, stood in a stack more than two feet high near the door.  he wanted to start from  the beginning .  he was born in russia, and his family fled to germany, france, switzerland, liechtenstein and the united states after the bolshevik revolution in 1917. one book, “the romanovs: the final chapter,” described a scene from 1992, with the baron reaching into his pocket and peeling off hundred-dollar bills to help financially strapped researchers identify the remains of members of the  executed family .  according to forbes, the baron also offered a $5 million reward to anyone who could locate the  amber room , a chamber of gold and amber in the catherine palace in st. petersburg, russia, that was once called the “eighth wonder of the world” and was looted by the nazis.  the baron, too, is credited with starting liechtenstein’s tourism industry, making hundreds of photos of the principality that he transferred to postcards, scarves and books at his souvenir shop in vaduz, the capital. tour buses stopped daily in front of his shop, he told international life magazine, and he boarded with a microphone, enticing the visitors inside by speaking to them in six languages.        sport, though, was perhaps his most consuming interest. “he said it’s the most passionate thing you can do,” said isabel fehr, the president of liechtenstein’s olympic committee. “sport is his dna.”  in 1932, at age 20, the baron won a french cycling championship for students. two years later, he visited an aunt in lausanne, switzerland. next door was a jewelry store owned by the president of the swiss olympic committee. did liechtenstein have an olympic committee? the baron was asked. why not?  he returned home, went into the mountains, and found a pair of skiers named hubert negele and franz schadler. one was a forest ranger, the other a weekend skier. neither had ever competed in a race.  liechtenstein made its olympic debut at the 1936 winter games in nearby garmisch-partenkirchen, germany. the baron attended as a correspondent for l’auto, a french predecessor to l’equipe, a leading sports newspaper. negele finished 51st in the downhill and schadler 54th. six downhill skiers were even slower. the baron had his story.  “there were 20 minutes’ difference” – actually about 18 – “between the first and the last,” the baron said. “it was no good.”  a bobsledder named eduard von falz-fein also competed for lichtenstein in those games. this led to confusion, apparently even in the files of the international olympic committee.            image        research for his autobiography, published in multiple languages, stood in a stack near the door.   credit  jun michael park for the new york times         as it turns out, the two similarly named men were cousins, born not three months apart. the bobsledder was eduard theodor von falz-fein, who died june 17, 1974. the baron is eduard oleg alexandrowitsch von falz-fein.        the mystery was resolved, once and for all, by an interview that david wallechinsky, president of the international society of olympic historians, conducted with the baron in april.  “he never said he competed,” wallechinsky said. “it’s a natural confusion that developed because they had the same name.” (the oldest living olympian appears to be john lysak, an american kayaker who is 103 and competed in the 1936 berlin olympics.)  the baron’s most visible and enduring impact on liechtenstein came at the  1936 summer games , presided over by hitler in berlin. reporters were placed behind hitler at the olympic stadium as a matter of security, the baron said.  “the germans thought, if we put the press table behind hitler nobody will put a bomb, so everything is safe,” the baron said.  a couple of days earlier, while the baron wandered the olympic village for a story, he noticed a flag similar to liechtenstein’s, with its horizontal blue and red bands. it must be a mistake, he thought. it was not an error. the flag belonged to haiti, which participated in the opening ceremony but did not compete.  the baron phoned the government of liechtenstein. its flag must be altered before the opening ceremony, he said. impossible, he was told. after the games, liechtenstein did change its flag — adding a crown in the blue field, a simple solution devised by the baron.        “i suggested not to make it too expensive — only to put the crown,” the baron said. “that way, you would not have to change the whole flag.”  in 1974, liechtenstein had its first big international skiing success when hanni wenzel, then 17, won the women’s slalom at the world championships in st. moritz, switzerland. when wenzel returned home, the baron held a party at his home and hired a popular austrian-swiss singer, udo jurgens, to croon “it was a very good year” for her.  “he’s done so much for liechtenstein,” wenzel said.  at the 1980 winter olympics in lake placid, n.y., wenzel won the slalom and giant slalom. they were her country’s first — and still only — gold medals. her daughter, tina weirather, second in the super-g at the 2017 world skiing championships, will seek to bring liechtenstein its first olympic medal in 30 years at the 2018 winter games in february in pyeongchang, south korea.  the baron follows weirather’s career closely. and if she wins at the olympics, who knows, perhaps he will hire someone to sing for her as he once did for her mother.  “we have been waiting since 1988 for a medal,” said wachter of the lichtenstein olympic committee. “this is a very important olympics for us. it’s so motivating and fascinating that the man who started the olympic movement in liechtenstein is still alive after 105 years and is still interested and standing behind the team. he’s living history.”       ',\n",
       " 'on thursday, the world anti-doping agency’s executive committee will gather in the seychelles to hold the most crucial antidoping meeting in recent times.  until friday, the russian anti-doping agency was deemed still not fit for reinstatement into the global antidoping community — a result of the egregious state-supported doping system exposed through the pound and mclaren investigations in 2015 and 2016. however, just days before the wada executive committee is to decide whether to bring russia back, wada has made a sudden about-face by releasing a recommendation that its executive committee vote for its return.  this has sparked shock among sports fans and clean athletes worldwide, who, like me, and with no transparency from the global antidoping body, are scratching their heads at this abrupt, curiously timed development. is this the same russia that has, until now, been vehemently opposed to the facts and evidence in the mclaren report?  as is widely known, rusada has still not met the two conditions required for reinstatement: as wada has consistently told us, the russian authorities had failed to publicly accept the outcomes of the mclaren report, which revealed broad, state-sponsored doping, and they had also failed to grant wada access to stored urine samples still held in a moscow laboratory.        now, despite wada’s change of heart, athletes and the public have still not seen public acknowledgment from russia of its state-sponsored doping program (as required by wada’s russian road map), and there has still not been a visit by wada officials to the laboratory to access urine samples. with those facts, what sort of confidence will wada’s volte-face instill?  wada’s decision is questionably timed, coming just as international athletes on friday began one of the strongest antidoping campaigns ever, imploring wada to make the right decision not to readmit russia. the decision will anger sports fans and clean athletes, whose trust in the global antidoping authority is already wafer thin. they want a  strong  wada that backs clean sport, and doesn’t look to appease a handful of sports politicians.  in recent weeks, sports officials, who represent half of wada, had been trying to persuade members of the executive committee to vote for the reinstatement of rusada. as a former athlete, and as someone who regularly speaks to athletes everywhere, i can tell you that they are shocked that this could happen.  let’s remind ourselves that just over two years ago, the results of the mclaren investigation revealed incontestable evidence that russia had perpetrated the most grotesque abuse of power and masterminded the biggest doping scandal in the history of sporting competition. yet the international olympic committee — ignoring wada’s recommendation — gave russia something of a pass and allowed some russian athletes to compete at the rio 2016 olympic games.  the world — including the overwhelming majority of athletes — looked on in astonishment as wada’s lack of power was so publicly exposed and the i.o.c. showed themselves to be so staggeringly out of touch. ever since that regrettable period, the priority of sporting figures at the i.o.c. and on wada’s executive committee has seemingly been to bring russia back.        take the i.o.c.’s “fudge” in february at the pyeongchang olympics where they “barred” russian athletes, only to open the door for 168 of the country’s athletes to compete in a uniform with the words ‘olympic athlete from russia’ emblazoned on the front. as if this wasn’t enough to perplex athletes and sports fans around the world, the i.o.c. then had the audacity to reinstate the russian olympic committee just days after the closing ceremony.  these decisions have left the antidoping system on life support. yet it still seems lessons have not been learned by the decision makers — the individuals responsible for representing clean competition and upholding trust in sport, not undermining it.  in the aftermath of the mclaren investigation, governments and antidoping organizations have made constructive efforts to reform the system, strengthen wada and give the agency the tools it needs, such as greater sanctioning powers. that, let’s remind ourselves, would have taken the decision of russian athletes’ participation at rio 2016 out of the hands of the i.o.c. and put it into wada’s.  the sports representation on the agency’s executive committee has often tried to stop wada from getting the sanctioning powers it needs. while the global athlete community expects us to come together and  strengthen  wada, the powers-that-be from the sporting movement continually attempt to  undermine  its power. this is, candidly, a dereliction of duty.  with wada’s sudden shift in position raising questions about its transparency and about where its loyalties lie, we must begin the journey of returning trust to the system, enhancing wada and creating a system fit for the next generations of athletes.  having spoken to athletes, i know they overwhelmingly support the  right  decision being made in the seychelles — they overwhelmingly support wada’s sticking to its road map. this was not the time, they say, for the global antidoping body to perform the u-turn of all u-turns.  has wada now performed the fudge of all fudges to appease the i.o.c., and to simply move on from “the russia issue”? given the facts, it would seem so. we must demand that the global antidoping authority make public its recommendation, and the reasons for it.  the antidoping movement owes it to athletes to return trust to the system by making open, fair decisions, because without their trust, where are we with the clean-sport effort? without that trust, where would it leave wada?

       " 'washington — a senate subcommittee investigating sexual abuse in olympic and amateur sports has asked the justice department and the f.b.i. to investigate scott blackmun, the former chief executive of the united states olympic committee, claiming that he lied to congress during its inquiry into how olympic entities handled the lawrence g. nassar molestation case.  two senators, jerry moran of kansas, the subcommittee’s chairman, and richard blumenthal of connecticut, the ranking member of the subcommittee that holds jurisdiction over the u.s.o.c. and amateur sports, sent referral letters on friday to matthew g. whitaker, the acting attorney general, and christopher a. wray, the f.b.i. director, saying blackmun had “made false claims and misled our subcommittee — harming the investigation and ability to develop policy.”  they added, “just as importantly, survivors of abuse have had to wait longer for the truth and longer for systemic changes to help prevent others from similar injury.”  the request came three days after  senator blumenthal formally asked the f.b.i.  to look into the role of the u.s.o.c. and u.s.a. gymnastics in the nassar case and what he called “their role in this massive cover-up.”        on monday, the law firm ropes &amp; gray  released a 233-page report detailing  some of the ways that both sports organizations mishandled the nassar case, which involved a longtime national gymnastics team doctor, who is now in prison, molesting hundreds of girls and women. it took steve penny, then the chief executive of u.s.a. gymnastics, five weeks to refer the case to the f.b.i. after learning of the abuse of national team gymnasts.  penny told blackmun and alan ashley, another high-level u.s.o.c. official, of the abuse in july 2015, but the olympic committee executives failed to report it to law enforcement, investigate it or even share the information with the organization’s own department that handled sexual abuse cases. the case was made public in september 2016 in an article  published by the indianapolis star .  blackmun resigned in february, and on his way out was given accolades from the u.s.o.c. board for doing “a phenomenal job.” he could not be reached for comment. ashley was fired on monday.          in june, blackmun submitted testimony to the senate subcommittee in lieu of testifying in person, saying he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, and also subsequently answered the senators’ questions. in his testimony, he said that he spoke to the u.s.o.c.’s safesport staff — the group that dealt with matters involving sex abuse — regarding the nassar accusations.        but according to monday’s report, ropes &amp; gray investigators found no evidence that blackmun followed up with anyone at the u.s.o.c. regarding the abuse allegations — despite blackmun’s initial claim that he started an internal review of the nassar matter. blackmun later told investigators that he was mistaken about that initiative.  the senate subcommittee is now claiming that blackmun’s “own statements to the independent investigators appear to contradict his statement to the subcommittee.”  larry probst, the chairman of the u.s.o.c., said in a teleconference on friday that it was “not appropriate” for the board to comment on blackmun’s case because it had not read the senators’ referral letters to the justice department and f.b.i.  “i cannot comment on what was going through scott’s mind and how he went through his decisions,” he said. “obviously, the system broke down in many aspects.”  probst said the breakdown began at u.s.a. gymnastics and included what happened at michigan state, where nassar was employed.  after a 10-year tenure leading the board, probst will step down as chairman at the end of this month. susanne lyons, who until july served as the u.s.o.c.’s interim chief executive, will replace him.  in the teleconference, lyons said that she and sarah hirshland, the organization’s new chief executive, would make it a priority to ensure that the communication between them is clear and that expectations of what hirshland needs to tell the board are exact.  “we need to have an open and honest conversation and make sure we are in alignment,” lyons said.

       " 'when christine girard was presented with the gold medal in weight lifting from the 2012 olympics, there was a podium, a canadian flag and an anthem sung by a choir. in the audience were olympians, officials, friends and family.  included among them were her three children, none of them yet born in 2012. that’s because the presentation of the medal came on monday, more than six years after the competition.  in london, girard lifted a total of 520 pounds, good for third place in her division. it was the first medal ever for a female canadian weight lifter. but in 2016, maiya maneza of kazakhstan and svetlana tsarukayeva of russia were disqualified after retesting of their samples revealed performance-enhancing drugs. girard became the retroactive gold medalist.  at the national arts center in ottawa, about 100 people gathered for a 20-minute ceremony during which girard finally got her gold medal.        “it was a win of our values, a win for clean sport,” girard said.  the increasing number of medal-winning athletes caught by testing years later, especially from the 2008 and 2012 games, has meant more and more athletes are receiving medals that for years they thought they had lost.            image     girard competing in the weight lifting event held at the 2008 olympics.   credit  ezra shaw/getty images         not all of them had elaborate ceremonies. adam nelson, the american shot-putter elevated to gold for the 2004 games, was  handed his medal o utside a burger king at the atlanta airport in 2013.  “anything they could do to recognize the athletes that were robbed of the moment would certainly go a long way toward repairing some of the damage that was done,” nelson  told usa today .  girard said: “i think it’s really important to have a big ceremony. the more we talk about the positive, the better it could be for future athletes.”        even when girard was competing, the specter of drugs hung over the competition. “unfortunately, my sport has a strong correlation between the results and taking drugs,” she said. of her competitors at the time, she said, “we had a lot of suspicion, but we had no proof.”  girard returned her 2012 bronze medal last spring. but the gold she was awarded on monday was not the one that maneza was given. “they made new medals or they took some from the museum,” girard said.  girard also received a bronze from the 2008 games in beijing, where she originally finished fourth.  besides her motherhood duties, the now-retired girard is planning to return to college for a master’s in occupational therapy.  she is bullish on the future for clean weight lifters.  “i wanted to prove that it was possible to beat them,” she said of drug users, “and stay true to who we are. i remember the first time i beat someone who got caught. i said, ‘see, see, i can do this.’”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — internet problems before and during the opening ceremony of the winter olympics on friday night are being investigated as a possible cyberattack, officials said saturday.  sung baik-you, a spokesman for the pyeongchang organizing committee, said saturday that some technical issues “impacted some of our noncritical systems last night for a few hours.”  mr. sung did not elaborate and said that the committee was investigating the cause. he said the attack “did not disrupt any event or have any effect on the safety or security of any athletes or spectators.” a spokeswoman for the committee said a cybersecurity team was assisting in the investigation.  during the ceremony, the wireless service in the stadium stopped working as soon as the ceremony began, hampering reporters and spectators who wanted to post on social media.        according to a  report  by the yonhap news agency, the attack disrupted some internet-based telecasts at the main press center. when organizers shut down servers to deal with the attack, the pyeongchang 2018 website stopped working, and some spectators who had bought tickets for the opening ceremony were unable to print out their reservations. according to reuters, drones that were scheduled to film the ceremony failed to deploy, forcing broadcasters to splice in prerecorded video.  mr. sung said that the organizers sold 99 percent of 35,000 tickets to the opening ceremony, though viewers noticed many empty seats.  it is possible the frigid weather kept some away, in addition to technical problems.  mark adams, a spokesman for the international olympic committee, said he hoped to have more information sunday.              a united states state department official said the state department’s diplomatic security service said it was aware of attack reports and continued to work closely with south korean law enforcement and security agencies, but deferred questions to the international olympic committee.        olympic games are often targets of cyberattacks and before the opening, the united states department of homeland security  warned  americans that cybercriminals would likely try to infiltrate the games.  north korea has a  persistent army of hackers  that have attacked central banks and movie studios. observers had hoped that the fact that north korean athletes were attending the games might ease the threat of cyberattacks, while others said that russian groups might seek to retaliate for a  ban on russian athletes .  in recent weeks, american security researchers at the security firms mcafee and fireeye fired off warnings about an escalating nation-state attack on olympic organizations. neither firm has been able to tie the active campaign back to one nation state, but they believe a state is responsible given the resources and organization involved, and the fact that there is little profit incentive to the attacks.  the attacks began last year with phishing emails to olympic-related targets. by january, researchers at mcafee said that attackers had successfully compromised several victims, installed malware on their machines and were now actively stealing data off their machines. at the time, attackers’ end goal remained unclear, but security experts across the industry said they have been bracing for what they now describe as an inevitable attack.  in the days leading up to friday’s opening ceremony, attackers had moved to phase 3 of their attack, ryan sherstobitoff, a senior analyst at mcafee, said on saturday.  over the past few days, mcafee’s advanced threat research team discovered that attackers had successfully installed a new, “more persistent implant” in victims’ servers that may have led to the opening ceremony disruptions, though investigators were still trying to nail down the exact cause on saturday.  “we do not have any further information beyond our discovery that would suggest the new implant led to it, but it is highly plausible,” mr. sherstobitoff wrote by email.  he said this new implant would give attackers the ability to do whatever they wished with victims’ machines, including potentially taking them offline.

       " 'ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik of north korea are not expected to win a medal in pairs figure skating at the 2018 winter olympics in south korea. but few athletes may have a more impactful presence next month at the games, which are being promoted as a chance to ease political and nuclear tensions on the divided korean peninsula after north korea announced tuesday that it would participate in the games.  the pairs team, which finished 15th at the world skating championships last year, is expected to represent the height of sporting aspirations for north korea. details are still being worked out about which athletes will compete, but ryom, who will turn 19 just days before the olympics begin, and kim, who is 25, are the only north koreans who have qualified for the 2018 games.  they are the lone elite, world-class winter athletes from the isolated nation, which has only won two medals at the winter games, a silver and bronze in speedskating, the last coming in 1992, and they have plenty of admirers among figure skating’s cognoscenti.  “they are so charismatic; i know the crowd would fall for them with their smile and passion and love of skating,” bruno marcotte, a prominent canadian pairs coach who worked with the skaters last summer in montreal and during an olympic qualifying competition in germany in september, said by phone on tuesday. “i feel they’ll be a crowd favorite.”        thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee, has made north korea’s participation a priority during the past year, and he said in a statement tuesday that north korea’s decision to take part in the 2018 winter games was “a great step forward in the olympic spirit.”  the olympic ideal has long been tarnished by scandal and prohibitive costs that make the games unaffordable to many cities. but the i.o.c., since its founding in the 19th century, has prided itself on the olympics serving as essentially a peace movement. they are meant to show that the world’s nations and athletes can come together and, if only for a brief period, the chance of conflict can be lessened.  for those who still subscribe to that ideal, hopes soared tuesday. “this is going to put a positive vibe into those games,” mr. marcotte said.  there is, too, a widely-expressed hope among south korean officials and international sports officials and athletes that north korea’s unpredictable leader, kim jong-un, will be less likely to behave provocatively during the olympics if his country’s athletes are participating.  last week, the north korean ruler boasted that the united states was within range of a nuclear arsenal he could operate with a button on his desk. president donald j. trump responded on twitter by bragging about the nuclear capabilities of the united states and the size of his button.        the jousting evoked somber olympic memories from three decades ago. ten months before the 1988 summer games were held in seoul, the south korean capital, north korean agents placed a bomb aboard a korean air flight and killed all 115 aboard in what south korean officials said was an attempt to undermine those olympics. north korea boycotted those games.  at the last major international sporting event held in south korea, soccer’s 2002 world cup, north korea provoked a naval skirmish with the south on the day that south korea played a match for third place.  but, on various fields of play, the two countries have been on convivial terms lately. last year, north korea sent its women’s national hockey team to play in south korea, and south korea sent its women’s soccer team to play in north korea. north korea also sent a taekwondo team to the south.  the two nations marched together in the opening ceremony at the 2000 and 2004 summer olympics. south korean officials have held open that possibility for the winter games.  south korean officials have also strenuously sought to play down security concerns ahead of the 2018 games, which will be held in pyeongchang, south korea, only about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates north and south.  “these worries are understandable,” choi moon-soon, governor of the south korean province where the olympics will take place, told reporters last year. but, referring to north korea, he added, “if they participate in the event, that threat disappears.”            image     the north korean pairs figure skating team of ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik relax and celebrate at the kiss and cry zone in eissportzentrum, oberstdorf last september.   credit  jun michael park for the new york times         it is not known whether kim jong-un had any plans to disrupt the pyeongchang games, but olympic insiders have said the presence of north korean athletes would allow them to rest more easily.        last week, at the united states figure skating championships, david raith, executive director of u.s. figure skating, said he welcomed north korea’s presence at the olympics.  “we’re hoping they’re there,” mr. raith said. “it would be the safest place in the world.”  north korea missed a deadline in late october to officially enter its pairs team into the olympics. and it does not yet appear to have made such a request, alexander lakernik, a russian who is vice president of the international skating union, said in a telephone interview on tuesday.  but adding the north koreans to the olympic pairs competition would be a simple procedure. and the i.o.c. has said it would keep the doors open to north korea’s participation for as long as possible. the olympic committee has also broached the idea of offering north korea wild-card entries in some nordic skiing sports and short-track speedskating.  discussions have been underway about the pairs team, mr. lakernik said, and given the special circumstances, “there could be an exception made; but first we need an application.”  while north korea has won 16 gold medals in the summer games, in such sports as weight lifting, wrestling and boxing, it is not a power in the more expensive winter sports. north korea did not participate in the 2014 winter games in sochi, russia. its officials have recently complained that tightened sanctions against the country have made it difficult to obtain some sports equipment.  in general, north korea has not appeared to follow the model of the former soviet union and east germany, which were both winter sports powers and used gold medals for propaganda purposes. but experts see participation in these games as an attempt by mr. kim to get sanctions eased and to reduce the chances of american military action.        “sports diplomacy is a sexy affair,” said lee sung-yoon, a korea expert at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university. “pyongyang has all the reason to jazz up the winter olympiad and be the center of attention.”  purely in skating terms, mr. marcotte, the coach said, the north koreans appear to be mirroring the chinese model of attempting to build pairs teams to an elite international level.  at the 2006 and 2010 winter olympics, chinese pairs won two of the three available medals and are among the favorites to win gold at the 2018 games. ryom and kim possess some of the dynamism seen in chinese pairs and also some of the classic, balletic style of russian skaters. there is western influence in their routines as well. they perform their short program to an instrumental version of the beatles’ “a day in the life.”  while qualifying for the 2018 games at a competition in germany in september, the skaters spoke several times with reporters and seemed relatively open. both ryom and kim are listed as students. both live in pyongyang, the north korean capital, where loyalists to the kim jong-un regime are permitted to reside.  “i want to continue to improve until i become world champion,” ryom said at the time.  one subject was off limits: the olympics, because no decision had yet been made about north korea’s participation.  and there seemed to be every attempt to avoid politics.  neither skater, for instance, wore pins commonly worn by north koreans that depict kim il-sung and kim jong-il, kim jong-un’s grandfather and father, who preceded him as the country’s dynastic rulers. and both skaters neglected to praise kim jong-un for their success, another common practice for north korean athletes.  mr. marcotte, the coach, said that all his interactions with the skaters had been about “sports, sports, sports.”        and while their performance at the olympics would carry broader meaning for many, he said, the skaters would most likely feel only the pressure that every skater feels — to perform at their best.  “they want to show the world that they’re a good team,” mr. marcotte said.

       " 'moscow — russian athletes cleared to take part in the coming winter games questioned the selection process that allowed them to compete as neutrals and forced others to stay home while putting a veil of doping suspicion over their careers.  “i think this was a lottery,” sofia prosvirnova, a russian speedskater, said on wednesday ahead of a meeting with president vladimir v. putin of russia. “i know very well the guys who were not allowed to go, and i know 100 percent that they were not guilty of anything.”  last week, the international olympic committee  published a list of 17 factors  it had used to determine whether a russian athlete was eligible to compete. athletes who were implicated in any part of the sprawling investigation into russian doping were not cleared to take part in the games.  mr. putin met with the athletes in his residence near moscow before their departure for the olympics, set to start next week in pyeongchang, south korea. he asked them to put behind thoughts about doping scandals and political intrigue and to concentrate on achieving victories.        “everything that happens around sports and around our athletes should not distract you,” mr. putin  told the cleared olympians . “concentrate on sports, knowing that hundreds of thousands, millions of fans, as usual, are following you, love you and hope you will win.”  after a nominal ban of the russian team from the games, the olympic committee  cleared 169 russian athletes  to compete as “olympic athletes from russia.” this is down from 232 russian olympians who dominated medal rankings at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia. it later appeared that they were dominant  largely because  of a carefully orchestrated cheating scheme.  mr. putin has been denying that any doping plot existed in sochi or that the kremlin ran a state-sponsored doping program in recent years, dismissing the accusations as part of a broad plan to weaken russia and punish it for its sports victories.  on tuesday, mr. putin described grigory rodchenkov, the former head of the moscow antidoping laboratory, as a “nut job” who “should be put in prison.” after fleeing russia, dr. rodchenkov claimed he was responsible for the russian doping program and personally running the doping scheme in sochi.  “everything is based on the testimony of this person,” mr. putin said during a campaign event in moscow. “can you trust him? we are told he is working under the control of american special services.”        mr. putin is set to win re-election in march to stay in the kremlin for a fourth term. he  said earlier  that the doping scandal was a plot to provoke anger among russian sports fans and athletes ahead of the election.  russian athletes, present at the meeting, were equally adamant about the accusations.  “i believe that what happened to our colleagues who are unable to participate in these games is a case of blatant injustice,” alena zavarzina, a russian snowboarder, told the gathering. “it is not fair.”  ilya kovalchuk, a russian ice hockey star, said the fact that many russian athletes were not qualified for the olympics puts more pressure on the hockey team.  “the olympic games is like a birthday party for the i.o.c.; they invite whoever they want,” mr. kovalchuk said before the event. “it is weird because they did not invite leaders from other sports. we are lucky that we are going and it will be even more pressure on us.”  the i.o.c. also ruled that russian athletes would not be allowed to use their national flag and that the national anthem would not be played when they won. at the meeting, many russian athletes wore shirts bearing the slogan “russia in my heart” under their neutral gray-and-red uniforms.  mr. putin was presented with one such jersey, bearing his name and signed by athletes.

       " 'breakdancing might seem like a product of the ’80s, like jelly bracelets or parachute pants. but some au courant sports officials believe it could have a bright future — at the olympic games.  plans are going smoothly for a new breakdancing event at the youth olympics in argentina in october, said lukas hinder, the president of the world dance sport federation, which promotes competitive dancing events.  “we are quite on track with the preparations for the youth olympic games,” hinder  told inside the games.   “it’s a youth-orientated sport, it’s very cool, it’s innovative, it’s something new.”  the breakdancing event will be the debut at the youth olympics of dance sport. it grabbed the spot ahead of more traditional dance competitions like ballroom and latin dancing.  the official program lists three medal events : “b boys,” “b girls” and “breaking mixed team.”        in what must be an olympics first, prospective contestants were invited to submit a video to audition for a spot in the competition. rich colon, 52, a pioneering b boy  known as crazy legs , was involved in the judging process to narrow the field.  the youth olympics can be a proving ground for events that eventually wind up in the olympics. the 2014 youth event in nanjing, china, included rugby sevens, which debuted at the olympics in 2016, and skateboarding, which will be added in 2020.  also on the bill for 2018 are a basketball dunk contest, cross-country running, futsal (indoor soccer), and beach handball.  the olympics had shown itself to be willing in recent years to bend the definition of sports, adding sport climbing, for example, for the 2020 games. but dancing has been a step too far — unless it’s on ice.  though breakdancing has not yet debuted, it has already spawned a dispute, inside the games reported. a breakdancer, serouj aprahamian, petitioned the i.o.c., claiming that the world dance sport federation, known mostly for ballroom dancing, was not the right group to run breakdancing competitions. it has “absolutely no connection or credibility with any legitimate entity in the worldwide breaking community,” he contended.        while there are plenty of breakdancers still out there, to many people it is still an art form most associated with the 1980s. should breakdancing succeed at the olympics, maybe the door would open for other ’80s events. among the possibilities:   rubik’s cube:  the top solvers can currently zip through the basic cube in less than 5 seconds. the olympics would probably want to use the more challenging supercubes, like the 6 by 6, which can take a minute and a half.   hacky sack:  the generically named “world footbag” site  reports that the record  number of keep-ups by one man is 63,326. that took almost nine hours. a team of two has kept the sack up for 20 hours. should the olympics be looking for something that fits more easily in a tv window, it could consider a timed challenge. the record number of touches in five minutes is more than 1,000.   donkey kong:  a longstanding dispute over the world record in the arcade game  seems to have come to a close , perhaps clearing the way for a showdown between nations in climbing ladders, jumping over barrels and hammering things. the olympics might also consider the football game tecmo bowl, although whichever nation  gets bo jackson  would have a big advantage.  once people are dancing, cubing and video gaming at the olympics, the door is wide open. could a gold medal for best mullet be far off?

       " 'the president of michigan state has resigned under pressure.  so have several members of the board of u.s.a. gymnastics.  now the heat turns to full boil on the united states olympic committee, whose officials did not even bother to sit in the michigan courtroom to hear the grim, brave testimony of more than 150 girls and women, some of them olympic champions, about how dr. lawrence g. nassar molested them when he was supposed to be healing them.  scott blackmun, the chief executive of the olympic committee, apologized in an open letter on wednesday, saying the committee “should have been there to hear it in person, and i am deeply sorry that did not happen.”  the olympic committee had been expecting to celebrate its medal haul at the winter games, which begin in two weeks in south korea. instead, it finds itself defending accusations that it did too little too late; that it was more concerned with protecting its image than its athletes; and that it did not even offer solace to victims, much less safeguards.        mr. blackmun’s letter to dr. nassar’s victims and survivors said: “we are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren’t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams. the olympic family is among those that have failed you.”  the letter came nearly a year and a half after the indianapolis star began publishing  an investigative series  about the sexual abuse of gymnasts. mr. blackmun’s words, no doubt meant to be heartfelt, seemed somewhat lawyerly. he did not say specifically that the united states olympic committee had failed the athletes. and the phrase “olympic family” added a tinge of creepiness to a case about molestation.  further complicating the situation for the olympic committee is that mr. blackmun, the face of the organization, is scheduled to undergo surgery for prostate cancer on friday. he announced this week that he would miss at least the start of the pyeongchang games.  his words in the open letter will bring little comfort to those assaulted by dr. nassar. so will the olympic committee’s contention that it followed proper procedures upon being informed in the summer of 2015 by u.s.a. gymnastics that gymnasts were being sexually abused.  the olympic committee has long asserted that it is responsible for athletes only in the short period from when they are named to the olympic team through a winter or summer games. at all other events and training camps that are not held at u.s.o.c. facilities, the national governing bodies are responsible for the care and feeding of their athletes. that will seem like evasive legalese to many, an explanation few are likely to accept.        that appears clear from the scathing rebuke of the olympic committee by aly raisman, the three-time olympic gold medalist, at a sentencing hearing last friday.  “neither u.s.a. gymnastics nor the u.s.o.c. have reached out to express sympathy or even their support — not even to ask: ‘how did this happen? what do you think we can do to help?’ ” ms. raisman said.  she continued: “why has the u.s. olympic committee been silent? why isn’t the u.s.o.c. here right now?”            image     the n.c.a.a. investigation of michigan state regarding dr. lawrence g. nassar, above, at his sentencing in michigan on wednesday, may be tricky to navigate.   credit  brendan mcdermid/reuters         olympic officials now say they applaud the athletes who have spoken out, but for too long the olympic committee ignored and dismissed those voices and showed no desire to investigate their accusations, ms. raisman said at the hearing.  “it is like being abused all over again,” she said.  the olympic committee and the gymnastics federation were “quick to capitalize on and celebrate my success” at two summer games, ms. raisman said. “but did they reach out when i came forward” about dr. nassar?  “no,” she said.  at this point, she said, “talk is worthless to me.” she added: “we’re dealing with real lives and the future of our sport. we need to believe this won’t happen again.”        on monday, ms. raisman accused the olympic committee on twitter of “shamelessly taking credit” for  the resignations of three members of the board of u.s.a. gymnastics  “as though they’re addressing the problem.”  the olympic committee was “still not acknowledging its own role in this mess,” ms. raisman wrote. “zero accountability! it’s like none of us were ever abused!”  she mocked a u.s.o.c. statement calling for gymnastics officials to focus on “supporting the brave survivors.” why hadn’t the olympic committee appeared in the michigan courtroom to show its own support? ms. raisman wondered.  “did they issue any statement then?” she wrote. “crickets.”  finally, on wednesday, mr. blackmun issued his open letter to dr. nassar’s victims and survivors. he laid out a four-point plan to “ensure this does not happen again.”  and in  a letter sent to u.s.a. gymnastics on thursday , mr. blackmun called for the resignations of all of its board members by next wednesday. he threatened to decertify the governing body if it didn’t fully embrace change. and he pledged “substantial funds” to assist athletes with reporting of abuse, treatment and counseling.  mr. blackmun also said that the olympic committee would begin an independent, third-party investigation of itself and u.s.a. gymnastics to “examine how an abuse of this proportion could have gone undetected for so long.”  “we need to know when complaints were brought forward and to who,” he wrote, adding that the results would be made public. it’s not yet clear who will lead that investigation.        senator jeanne shaheen, democrat of new hampshire, also called on wednesday for a congressional investigation, complete with subpoena power, of the olympic committee and the gymnastics federation.  “this was not a case of negligence or failed oversight on the part of the u.s.o.c. and u.s.a. gymnastics,” she wrote in a letter to senate leaders. “these organizations have serious questions to answer, including why they allowed this criminal behavior to occur” over many years.  recently, americans have “experienced an awakening with regard to the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace,” ms. shaheen wrote.  now it is time, she added, “to expose the scope and nature of sexual assault against vulnerable girls and boys under supervision of the u.s.o.c. and its affiliated organizations so that these crimes are never allowed to happen again.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — officials from the korea meteorological administration sat behind microphones in front of an overflow audience of journalists. interpreters converted the officials’ words through the headsets of those unable to speak korean.  there was anxiousness. people put their thumbs to their phones, ready to share the news on twitter immediately. it was as if punxsutawney phil were making his groundhog day weather prediction in a teeming conference room.  the message was hardly a revelation: it will be cold at the winter olympics.  but in this case, it has been bracingly — at times subzero — cold, especially compared with previous winter olympics. sochi, russia, was freakishly balmy four years ago. so was vancouver, british columbia, four years before that. veterans of these events suggested that pyeongchang in 2018 might be the coldest olympics since 1994 in lillehammer, norway.  “it’s nice to have it finally feel like winter,” said ida sargent, an american cross-country skier. “that’s not something we always see, especially in the last few years, with mild winters. it’s fun to embrace winter and remember that we’re winter-sports athletes.”        athletes and coaches were quick to point out that they frequently deal with cold and difficult weather conditions on their international circuits, but placed pyeongchang among the coldest, along with colder-sounding, more northerly places like siberia, finland and canada.            image     a ski course worker wearing a face mask to keep warm at jeongseon alpine centre.   credit  doug

cross-country skiers said they would wear long underwear under their skintight suits. skiers will crowd into the heated start houses to keep loose. biathletes are experimenting with just the right gloves to wear to keep them warm while giving them the dexterity to load and fire their rifles.  “sometimes when you change to a thicker glove, your hands still freeze,” tim burke, an american biathlete, said. “then it’s kind of a double whammy.”        the winter games are being held in two places about 20 miles apart — the mountain resort of pyeongchang, where the  opening ceremony  on friday and outdoor events like skiing and bobsled will take place, and the (slightly warmer) coastal city of gangneung, where indoor-arena sports such as figure skating and hockey will be.  temperatures are rising slightly toward the weekend, but during the past week in pyeongchang, they dipped below 0 degrees fahrenheit (minus 18 celsius). with just enough breeze to keep all the flags twitching, their fabric somehow not frozen, it felt even colder.            image        the persistently cold temperatures are perfect for snow making, with the ski courses expected to be in top condition.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         people were bundled in layers to the point of limited flexibility and identifiability. reports of viciously cold weather last weekend at a rehearsal for the opening ceremony sent worry through the waves of underdressed new arrivals. photographs circulated of athletes putting athletic tape on their faces to prevent frostbite on noses and cheeks.  the cold’s impact extended beyond people to things. photographers said that wires used to rig equipment at the outdoor venues quickly became brittle and snapped at the slightest tug. workers were careful not to step on any cable stretched across the frozen ground, lest it shatter underfoot. there was a report that racing skis were warping in the cold, rendering them useless after one run.  the unsung heroes of the olympics might be the quiet and colorful army of volunteers, many of them young people stationed outdoors in parking lots or in front of buildings wearing matching snow jackets and pants. they are ceaselessly polite, too polite to admit any regret for volunteering to stand in the freezing cold.  some of the tour buses carrying officials and journalists on a spirograph-like circuit among venues and athletes’ villages and news media villages come equipped with hot coffee. at stops, bus drivers sometimes pour coffee and deliver it to the volunteers outside.        for olympic organizers, however, the most urgent concern was the opening ceremony at the olympic stadium, an open-air pentagon of massive bleachers. spectators will receive bags filled with hot packs, seat warmers and windbreakers, meant to limit the chances of  hypothermia, which struck seven people  at an hourslong event there in november.            image        a television camera with special hand warmers.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         the opening ceremony is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. local time and last a swift 2 hours 15 minutes, much shorter than usual. if nothing else, the weather should keep athletes from lollygagging and help limit everyone’s exposure to both the elements and, perhaps, lengthy speeches by officials and politicians.  on wednesday afternoon, the stern-faced head of the meteorological administration predicted that temperatures friday night would be in the 20s fahrenheit (minus 2 to minus 5 celsius), with wind that made it feel like the midteens (minus 10 celsius). those are typical conditions for pyeongchang, the throng at the weather news conference was told.  if newcomers were caught by surprise, others knew what to expect.  tom johnston, an american who is helping oversee the alpine skiing courses, said it might be the coldest place he has ever prepared for races. the temperatures are low (but, on average, warmer than, say, lake placid, n.y., this time of year), and wind is a steady and silent accomplice.  johnston said it was especially tricky to build a course where the jumps were shielded by berms and stands of trees to block the persistent gusts.  winds are expected to be strong beginning on sunday, the day of the men’s downhill ski race.  for all the anxiety over the cold, there is very little over another element: snow.        pyeongchang gets relatively little accumulation, and there is little snow to be seen on the mountainsides. but the persistently cold temperatures are perfect for snow making. the ski courses, visible from town as curling white ribbons on a backdrop of green, are expected to be in top condition, without worry that a sudden storm will interfere with the course or racing.  “if a guy goes first, a guy goes 30th, a guy goes 50th, it’s going to be fair,” said coberger, the new zealand coach. “so that’s really nice. that’s what the cold brings.”

       " 'washington — in a fiery hearing prompted by the larry nassar sex abuse scandal in gymnastics, congress on wednesday turned a glaring spotlight on the united states olympic committee and its failure to ensure the safety of athletes across multiple sports under its watch.  at one point, a congressman shouted at the committee’s acting chief executive, susanne lyons, “you are not fit to serve in this job!”  ms. lyons, in the hearing examining how olympic entities protected athletes from sex abuse, endured repeated questioning from lawmakers about the u.s.o.c.’s longstanding view that sports’ governing bodies — and definitely not the olympic committee — are solely responsible for the well-being of athletes.  when asked by gregg harper, republican of mississippi, if the olympic committee’s top priority is to keep athletes safe, ms. lyons answered, “it is a top priority.”        mr. harper responded, “we’re all worried that it hasn’t always been the case.”  u.s.a. gymnastics and several other governing bodies, including those for swimming, taekwondo and volleyball, have recently faced major sex abuse scandals. the heads of those sports joined ms. lyons and testified on wednesday to a house subcommittee investigating how the nassar scandal happened and determining what the u.s.o.c. and the governing bodies are doing to prevent future abuse.  it seems to have taken dr. nassar’s conviction, and further molestation accusations from more than 250 girls and women, for congress to snap to attention about the issue of sex abuse in sports and for the u.s.o.c. to realize it was time to stop pawning off responsibility.  “there appears to be a history of the u.s.o.c. knowing about allegations of sexual abuse and doing nothing,” said greg walden, republican of oregon, explaining how the olympic committee has claimed that it “has no athletes” and does not have to safeguard them. he asked ms. lyons what authority, under the ted stevens olympic and amateur sports act, the u.s.o.c. has to protect athletes from abuse.  “i think that the act gives us much broader authority than we’ve exercised in the past,” she said.  buddy carter, republican of georgia, was so upset that the olympic committee did not use its authority in the past to stop abuse that he shouted at ms. lyons, “you should resign the position now,” before saying she was not fit to serve in the job.  that broader authority, ms. lyons said, means the u.s.o.c. will be taking an active role in figuring out how the olympic movement proceeds after dr. nassar’s case altered the landscape. she said it was a priority for the olympic committee to consolidate a public list of everyone who has been barred from their sports because of sexual abuse. those lists are now kept by some of the 48 governing bodies, and another list has been made public by the united states center for safesport, a national nonprofit organization that investigates and provides prevention education about sex abuse claims in sports.        those lists are growing by the day. according to shellie pfohl, president of safesport, who testified on wednesday, the organization fielded 20 to 30 cases per month last year after opening in march. this year, she said, it has fielded 20 to 30 per week, with a spike in cases after dr. nassar’s trial. in all, the organization has five full-time and seven contracted investigators to work on those cases.  some committee members were concerned that safesport would not have enough funding to adequately investigate the flood of incoming cases, even though the u.s.o.c. announced earlier this year that it would double the funding it will provide to safesport, which has an annual budget of $4.6 million. the u.s.o.c.’s funding rose to $3.1 million.  “whatever money you need to actually do your work, let us know and we will help you,” said diana degette, democrat of colorado.  the committee criticized each governing body at the hearing for its mistakes regarding sex abuse in their sports.  u.s.a. volleyball, for example, barred the chicago-area coach rick butler for life in 1995 for multiple accusations of sex abuse involving minors. yet he was allowed back into the sport five years later, only to be barred for life this year, without chance for reinstatement, for similar accusations of abuse.  u.s.a. taekwondo suspended an athlete for sexual misconduct, yet that athlete still showed up at a high-performance center at the rio olympics, after going through the u.s.o.c. for accreditation.  but none of the governing bodies at the hearing received as much criticism as u.s.a. gymnastics, whose new chief executive, kerry perry, spoke publicly about dr. nassar’s case for the first time and said what so many of his victims would like to hear: i’m sorry.        ms. perry apologized “to all who were harmed by the horrific acts” and said she was “appalled and sickened by the despicable crimes of larry nassar.”  she said she thinks of dr. nassar’s victims every day, and they embolden her to make sure no more gymnasts are ever hurt again.  “let there be no mistake,” she said. “those days are over.”  last march, u.s.a. gymnastics declined to send any of its officials to congress for a hearing about sexual abuse in sports, even though its practices were specifically under scrutiny after dr. nasser’s case.  in the days before that hearing, steve penny, the longtime chief executive of u.s.a. gymnastics, resigned. before wednesday’s hearing here, the gymnastics organization made similar bold moves.  under pressure from current and former athletes, as well as from congress and the u.s.o.c., u.s.a. gymnastics announced several changes to its structure minutes before the hearing. it will shrink its board of directors to 15 from 21, and a majority of those directors must be independent from the organization. in the past, the overwhelming majority of the board was involved in or had direct ties to the sport.  last week, in the middle of a national team training camp in tennessee, ms. perry fired rhonda faehn, who had been running the women’s program, and announced that a restructuring and layoffs were underway. in 2015, gymnasts told ms. faehn that dr. nassar had abused them, which she reported to mr. penny, the organization’s president at the time.  the reorganization is just the latest step u.s.a. gymnastics has taken since dr. nassar’s case has shaken the sport to its core.        after simone biles, the olympic champion and current face of the sport, said on social media that she did not want to attend training camp at the national team training center in texas, where dr. nassar abused countless women, u.s.a. gymnastics closed the camp there. after the u.s.o.c. asked u.s.a. gymnastics to dismantle its board of directors, the organization shooed its entire board out the door.  last week, ms. perry also spent time in los angeles discussing settlements with gymnasts abused by dr. nassar, who had been the longtime national team doctor.  “usag and the u.s.o.c., their responsibility was to protect us and they failed because they just didn’t pay attention,” said jessica howard, a former rhythmic gymnast who was molested by dr. nassar and who attended wednesday’s hearing. “now they’re finally paying attention because everybody is watching.”  but even after a three-hour hearing, there remained uncertainty that the olympic organizations would follow through or act quickly enough to make changes.  “honestly, i’m not reassured by your testimony because i don’t hear a sense of urgency,” debbie dingell, democrat of michigan, said to ms. lyons and the others testifying.  ms. dingell noted how long it took for safesport to become fully operational. it opened in march 2017, though the u.s.o.c. began working on the concept seven years before. there also was a delay to open safesport because the u.s.o.c. was waiting for a promise of five years of funding.  to that, ms. lyons said: “frankly, it took too long and we regret that it did not open sooner. it may have saved some of the tragedy that occurred.”        but ms. dingell was not satisfied that the u.s.o.c. has learned its lesson and that it would now rush to make changes to protect athletes from abuse.  “you keep telling me, ‘we’re working on it, we’re setting up a study,’” ms. dingell said to ms. lyons, as she raised her voice. “is it going to take another five years? what are we doing to protect these young people right now so this never happens again?”       ',\n",
       " 'the olympic gold medalist jordyn wieber told a united states senate subcommittee on wednesday that u.s.a. gymnastics, the u.s. olympic committee, and michigan state university had failed to protect its athletes from sexual abuse by  dr. lawrence g. nassar .  “to this day, i still don’t know how he could have been allowed to do this for so long,” ms. wieber said. “if these institutions had done their job, neither of us would be sitting here today.”  ms. wieber and jamie dantzscher, a fellow olympic gymnast, testified in front of a subcommittee tasked with investigating the handling of sexual abuse allegations made by dozens of young female athletes against dr. nassar, a former team doctor for u.s.a. gymnastics and a former member of the m.s.u. faculty.  the hearing, held by the subcommittee on consumer protection, product safety, insurance, and data security, which holds jurisdiction over the u.s. olympic committee and amateur sports, was the next step in the bipartisan inquiry into the systemic problems of abuse in the american gymnastics program.         at least 265 women came forward  to testify against dr. nassar in sentencing hearings this winter after he pleaded guilty to multiple counts of sexual assault and child pornography charges. he is serving the first of what amounts to multiple life sentences in federal prison in arizona.  senator richard blumenthal, democrat of connecticut and the subcommitee’s ranking member, said wednesday’s hearing was “a critical step forward.”  “across olympic sports, there are stories of young athletes who have been victimized and have survived physical, emotional and sexual abuse,” senator blumenthal said. “we want to fight it, and correct it, and prevent it from happening again.”  ms. dantzscher, who won a bronze medal at the 2000 olympic games, said she had spoken out about dr. nassar’s abuse beginning that year and received criticism from members of the u.s.a. gymnastics staff. she urged the committee to question the organization’s former chairman, paul parilla, and its former president, steve penny, and to hold u.s.a. gymnastics accountable.  “this is a case of powerful people protecting other powerful people,” ms. dantzscher said. “it is up to you, as powerful members of the united states senate, to hold them accountable, and i believe you will.”        in addition to the gymnasts, a retired former speedskater, bridie farrell, and a u.s. figure skater and coach, craig maurizi, also testified about having experienced trauma dating to as far as 40 years ago. mr. maurizi said he informed the u.s. figure skating association about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of a coach, richard callaghan, more than a decade ago.  mckayla maroney, one of ms. wieber’s teammates on the 2012 u.s. gymnastics team, submitted written testimony to the committee and said her abuse from dr. nassar started when she was 13.  on tuesday, ms. wieber filed a lawsuit against u.s.a. gymnastics, the u.s. olympic committee, and michigan state, alleging that the organizations could have done more to prevent dr. nassar from abusing athletes. nearly 300 similar lawsuits have already been filed against michigan state and u.s.a. gymnastics.  “we appreciate the willingness of these athletes — who share in our determination to root out abuse in youth sport governing bodies — to share their stories,” senator jerry moran, republican of kansas and the chairman of the subcommittee, said, “and aid in our investigation to protect all u.s.o.c. athletes, at all levels, in all sports.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — as the winter olympics prepared to open on friday, the united states olympic committee defended its embattled chief executive, saying it would not immediately replace him despite growing calls for his resignation resulting from the uproar over sexual abuse of gymnasts by a former national team doctor.  the chief executive, scott blackmun, was not here to lead the american delegation; he had said he would be unable to attend the opening ceremony friday in order to undergo treatment for prostate cancer.  larry probst, the chairman of the olympic committee, said at a news conference in pyeongchang, south korea, that no decision on mr. blackmun’s future would be made until the completion of an independent investigation into how the organization handled the sexual abuse accusations.  mr. probst, however, did seem to support mr. blackmun while also suggesting the brewing crisis could have been managed differently.        “we think that we did what we were supposed to,” he said. “could we have done more? of course. you can always do more.”  regarding mr. blackmun, mr. probst said, “he has served the u.s.o.c. with distinction” since becoming its chief executive in 2010. “we think that he did what he was supposed to do and did the right thing at every turn.”  at the same time, mr. probst said that after the results of the investigation are made public, “whatever actions are required and are appropriate, based upon on that investigation, will be taken by our board.”  to the hundreds of girls and women who have said they were sexually abused by dr. lawrence g. nassar, the gymnastics team doctor who has been convicted of multiple sex crimes, mr. probst said, “the olympic system failed you and we are so incredibly sorry.”  he did not say specifically that the u.s.o.c. had failed the athletes, seeming to choose his words carefully, perhaps attempting to shield the olympic committee’s liability in several lawsuits that have been filed. asked to clarify, mr. probst noted that the u.s.o.c. was part of the olympic system.        more than 260 athletes, several of them olympic medalists, have accused dr. nassar, who has been sentenced to decades in prison, of abusing them, often in the guise of medical treatment.  the appearance of scores of the athletes at his sentencing hearings last month threw the olympic committee into crisis as several publicly accused it of not doing enough to protect them.  through his tenure as chief executive, mr. blackmun has been highly regarded and viewed as a stabilizing force in an organization previously troubled by chaotic leadership. he has served in a number of roles at the u.s.o.c., including general counsel.  mr. blackmun’s diligent efforts to repair a damaged relationship between united states olympic officials and the international olympic committee resulted in los angeles being named as the host city for the 2028 summer games.  but criticism of the u.s.o.c.’s handling of the gymnastics abuse scandal — one of the largest in sports history — has led two united states senators and a group of about 30 former olympians, athletes’ representatives and child-advocacy experts to call for mr. blackmun to step down.  “he’s done,” said edward g. williams, a lawyer in new york who competed in the biathlon in the 1968 winter olympics and is a prominent advocate for athletes’ rights. “scott’s leadership flaw was that he forgot who he serves. he serves the athletes; he doesn’t serve the n.g.b.s,” parlance for national sports governing bodies.  mr. williams is a chief organizer of a group of athletes, coaches and lawyers called the committee to restore integrity to the u.s.o.c. this week, the group called for mr. blackmun’s ouster, after similar demands made recently by senators jeanne shaheen, a democrat from new hampshire, and joni ernst, a republican from iowa.        the senators called for mr. blackmun to step down after a report in the wall street journal that the u.s.o.c. did not intervene despite learning in 2015 from u.s.a. gymnastics that gymnasts were victims of possible sexual misconduct by dr. nassar, a year before accusations became public in an investigation by the indianapolis star.  the u.s.o.c. has said it followed proper procedures and was told that the authorities were being contacted. but the new york times has reported that as an f.b.i. investigation plodded along between july 2015 and september 2016, at least 40 girls and women say dr. nassar molested them during that period.  the olympic reform group has sent a 13-page report to the house committee on energy and commerce, which is investigating the sexual abuse of gymnasts.  in its letter, the reform group described what it said was a failure by mr. blackmun and the olympic committee to sufficiently protect athletes from sexual abuse over the past three decades in various sports such as gymnastics, taekwondo, swimming and speedskating.  athletes who complained of sexual abuse were left to fend for themselves in arbitration instead of being able to rely on the u.s.o.c. for safety, the group said in its report. as a result, it said, mr. blackmun and the olympic committee “created the underlying conditions for sexual abuse to thrive by cutting athletes off from institutional support.”  one of the reform group members is nancy hogshead-makar, a three-time gold medalist in swimming at the 1984 summer olympics in los angeles and a lawyer who said she was serving as an expert on sexual abuse on behalf of some gymnasts in civil litigation.  in a statement, ms. hogshead-makar said that mr. blackmun “allowed one of the country’s largest youth-serving organizations to avoid basic child protection measures, such as prohibitions on adults being alone with children.”        she added: “he has instructed the u.s.o.c. to sit on the sidelines when athletes have been sexually abused. he has ignored the pleas of athletes, all in order to serve the u.s.o.c.’s corporate interests of limited civil liability. he does not deserve to lead our olympic team.”  mark jones, a spokesman for the u.s.o.c., said friday: “we’ve seen the letter and obviously fundamentally disagree on a number of points. there are some instances in the letter that are flat-out untrue, and we look forward to further discussing it with the house energy and commerce committee.”  steven ungerleider, a sports psychologist in eugene, ore., who said that his consulting team had interviewed 18 of dr. nassar’s accusers, provided the times with an email copy of a letter he said he had recently sent to mr. blackmun, urging him to resign.  mr. ungerleider, who has been affiliated with the u.s.o.c. for three decades, wrote that he urged mr. blackmun more than a year ago to intervene with u.s.a. gymnastics and to say something public about the abuse scandal.  mr. blackmun’s reply, according to mr. ungerleider’s letter, was that lawyers representing the olympic committee recommended that officials “keep our heads low and our mouths shut.”  the athletes abused by dr. nassar needed the u.s.o.c.’s support, but instead received a “deathly silent” response from mr. blackmun, mr. ungerleider wrote. he added, “your lack of oversight, fiduciary duty and moral compass has been despicable.”  mr. jones said he had not yet seen mr. ungerleider’s letter and would not comment until he had read it.

       " 'russia is nominally barred from the coming winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, because of its state-backed doping program and an elaborate cheating scheme carried out at the last winter games. but russia announced on thursday it would send a robust team of 169 athletes to the games, where they will compete as individual “olympic athletes from russia.”  that number is not far off the size of the russian teams at past winter olympics. russia had 232 athletes at the sochi games in 2014, where it dominated the medal standings, and 177 in vancouver in 2010.  the international olympic committee  announced in december  that russian government officials would be forbidden to attend the 2018 games, the nation’s flag would not be displayed and its anthem would not be played.  but olympic officials also said that athletes from russia could receive special dispensation to compete if they satisfied the scrutiny of an antidoping review panel.        the work of that review panel, conducted over the last month, was opaque, even as antidoping regulators requested that the criteria used to evaluate each russian athlete be made public. leading up to the 2016 summer olympics in rio, the i.o.c. had reversed the presumption of innocence, considering all russian athletes tainted by their nation’s system of cheating unless they could prove a history of rigorous drug testing.  last friday, global olympic officials announced they had  cleared 389 russian athletes  to potentially compete in pyeongchang, a generous pool that some criticized as neutering the sting of the i.o.c.’s punishment on a major sports power that had brazenly breached drug-testing controls.  “to protect the rights of clean athletes,” antidoping officials from 20 nations  said  in a statement last week, “it is necessary for the bar to be higher for oar to compete in the upcoming olympic winter games,” they said, using the acronym for olympic athletes from russia.  on thursday, the i.o.c. named 17 factors it had taken into account in weighing eligibility for the potential russian olympians. among the issues considered, the organization said, was each athlete’s possible implication in a  sprawling investigation  that raised questions about more than 1,000 athletes across 30 sports.  officials also took into account a giant database regulators obtained from whistle-blowers last fall, reflecting incriminating drug tests from russia’s national drug-testing lab in moscow. the i.o.c. did not specify, however, how those criteria were applied, or if an athlete’s implication had necessarily constituted an automatic disqualification.        a spokesman for the i.o.c. said thursday he had not seen the russian olympic committee’s list. “the official list of invited russian athletes will not be released before the delegate registration meeting on saturday,” he said.  thomas bach, the top global olympic official, has defended his choice to allow a “new generation” of russian athletes to compete. last week the i.o.c. barred 111 others from taking part in the games ever again, and more than 50 doctors and coaches were denied invitations.  forty-two russian olympians have been banned for life as a result of the doping scandal, a punishment that the majority of those athletes have been litigating before the top international sports court this week, hoping to be exonerated before the games open on feb. 9.  russia’s full delegation, the russian news agency  tass reported,  will be 340 people. many of the athletes are expected to be first-time olympians, the i.o.c. said. still, some may occupy competition spots earned by their banned compatriots, who have been competing across numerous winter sports this season and qualifying for the games in spite of their inability to attend.  a number of gold medal contenders are on russia’s list, including the figure skating star evgenia medvedeva. last month, medvedeva traveled with top russian sports officials to lausanne, switzerland, where the i.o.c.’s headquarters are, to lobby olympic executives hours before they announced russia’s punishment.  international paralympic officials barred all russian athletes from the 2016 games in rio, in contrast to their olympic counterparts, who ultimately  cleared  roughly 270. the paralympic committee is expected to announce its decision about russia’s participation in the 2018 games on monday.

       " 'eric maleson was walking down a busy street in downtown rio de janeiro in july 2009 when he encountered a senior official connected with the city’s bid to host the 2016 summer olympics.  after exchanging the usual pleasantries, maleson, then a member of brazil’s olympic committee, knew that the official, ruy cezar miranda, an aide to the city’s mayor, had just returned from a trip to nigeria for a meeting with a group of african members of the international olympic committee.  “so how did it go?” maleson said he asked miranda. “it was a great success,” was the reply from a beaming miranda, who made a gesture with his hand that, maleson said, was meant to signal that a payment had been made to secure what could be crucial votes to select the host of the 2016 summer games.  maleson related the story to a judge on wednesday as part of his testimony in the corruption trial of carlos arthur nuzman, the former head of brazil’s national olympic committee and president of the 2016 olympic organizing committee.        “i have no doubt he wanted me to know the rio bid could take care of business,” maleson said in an interview on thursday, a day after giving testimony via video from his home in boston to the judge hearing the nuzman trial.  miranda could not be reached for comment.  nuzman’s downfall followed a joint investigation by prosecutors in brazil and france. they allege the rio election was just one of several major hosting decisions that had been corrupted by a culture of kickbacks and bribery dating back several years, including suspicious payments linked to the host city for the 2020 summer olympics, tokyo.  maleson’s day in court had been a long time coming. the former bobsledder, who founded and led brazil’s ice sports federation for more than a decade until his ouster in 2013, had for years  complained about corrupt practices  in brazil. he sent emails and letters to the i.o.c., even copying some to the organization’s president, thomas bach, and his predecessor, jacques rogge.  while he was largely ignored by sports officials, investigators took a keener interest. united states authorities arranged for maleson to be interviewed by a french prosecutor investigating the former president of track and field’s governing body, lamine diack of senegal. diack, now in his 80s, remains under arrest in france. he and his son, a sports marketing consultant, are the subjects of an interpol arrest warrant.  those interviews with maleson helped french authorities understand payments that are now believed to be part of the bribery scheme.        in separate evidence, details of which were published this month, carlos emanuel miranda, a former lieutenant to the former governor of rio de janeiro, sérgio cabral, told prosecutors as part of a plea-bargain agreement that payments were made to african sporting officials in relation to the 2016 bid in which rio overcame madrid, tokyo and chicago. cabral is in prison for corruption and money laundering.  cabral told miranda that four african votes were bought, according to his testimony. nuzman is accused of conspiring with cabral and the united states-based brazilian businessman arthur soares filho to bribe voters. he is also accused of tax evasion, money laundering and running a criminal organization after the police found more than $150,000 in his home and linked him to a swiss vault containing 16 gold bars.  nuzman, who was briefly jailed and is now under house arrest, denies the charges, and his lawyer has described the plea-bargain testimony as worthless.  maleson told the court that nuzman and cabral had made a pact to use the olympics as a springboard for cabral’s presidential ambitions. the relationship was common knowledge within the brazilian sporting movement, maleson said. “it was the perfect platform to give him visibility,” he added.  revelations from the case are a continuing embarrassment for the international olympic committee, which has changed the bidding process for future olympic hosts.  a recent opinion poll in switzerland, where sion is considering a run to host the 2026 winter games, suggested much work needed to be done to restore credibility. forty-seven percent of respondents said they would vote no in a crucial referendum next month on whether to formally pursue an olympic bid; 31 percent said they had no confidence in the i.o.c.; and another 32 percent chose not to answer.  judge marcelo bretas is expected to hear testimony from i.o.c. officials before reaching a verdict in the case against nuzman and leonardo gryner, who held senior roles with the rio 2016 organizing committee. a spokesman for the i.o.c. said it had “cooperated from the very beginning of these investigations because we have the highest interest to get this clarified.”       ',\n",
       " 'lausanne, switzerland — russia’s olympic team has been barred from the 2018 winter games in pyeongchang, south korea. the country’s government officials are forbidden to attend, its flag will not be displayed at the opening ceremony and its anthem will not sound.  any athletes from russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniform, and the official record books will forever show that russia won zero medals.  that was the  punishment issued tuesday  to the proud sports juggernaut that has long used the olympics as a show of global force but was exposed for systematic doping in previously unfathomable ways. the international olympic committee, after completing its own prolonged investigations that reiterated what had been known for more than a year, handed russia penalties for doping so severe they were without precedent in olympics history.  the ruling was the final confirmation that the nation was guilty of executing an extensive state-backed doping program. the scheme was rivaled perhaps only by the notorious program conducted by east germany throughout the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s.        now the sports world will wait to see how russia responds. some russian officials had threatened to boycott if the i.o.c. delivered such a severe punishment.            the olympic events that could be most affected by the russian ban  russian athletes could have been medal contenders in about a third of the 102 events at next year’s winter olympic games.       president vladimir v. putin seemed to predict a boycott of the pyeongchang games with a defiant dismissal of the doping scandal and a foreign policy in recent years that has centered on the premise that he has rescued russia from the humiliation inflicted on it by the west after the collapse of the soviet union. his spokesman, dmitri s. peskov, said no boycott was under discussion before the announcement, however, and the news broke late in the evening in moscow when an immediate official reaction was unlikely.  in barring russia’s team, olympic officials left the door open for some russian athletes. those with histories of rigorous drug testing may petition for permission to compete in neutral uniforms. a panel appointed by the international olympic committee will rule on each athlete’s eligibility.  although it is unknown exactly how many will clear that bar, it is certain that the contingent from russia will be depleted significantly. entire sports — such as biathlon and cross-country skiing, in which russia has excelled and in which its drug violations have been many — could be wiped out completely.        olympic officials made two seemingly significant concessions to russia:  ¶ any of its athletes competing under a neutral flag will be referred to as olympic athletes from russia. that is a departure from how the i.o.c. has handled neutral athletes in the past. for example, athletes from kuwait, which was barred from the 2016 summer games, were identified as independent olympic athletes last year in rio de janeiro.  ¶ olympics officials said they might lift the ban on russia in time for the closing ceremony, suggesting the nation’s flag could make a symbolic appearance in the final hours of the pyeongchang games.            russian doctor explains how he helped beat doping tests at the sochi olympics  a step-by-step look at how russian agents used an elaborate scheme to swap out tainted urine samples for clean ones taken months earlier.       thomas bach, president of i.o.c., has said he was perturbed not only by russia’s widespread cheating but by how it had been accomplished: by corrupting the olympic laboratory that handled drug testing at the games, and on orders from russia’s own olympic officials.  “this decision should draw a line under this damaging episode,” mr. bach said at a news conference, noting that alexander zhukov, the president of russia’s olympic committee whom the i.o.c. suspended from its membership tuesday, had issued an apology — something global regulators have long requested from the nation.  in an  elaborate overnight operation  at the 2014 sochi games, a team assembled by russia’s sports ministry tampered with more than 100 urine samples to conceal evidence of top athletes’ steroid use throughout the course of competition. more than two dozen russian athletes have been  disqualified from the sochi  standings as a result, and olympic officials are still sorting through the tainted results and rescinding medals.  at the coming games, mr. bach said tuesday, a special medal ceremony will reassign medals to retroactive winners from sochi. but, in light of legal appeals from many of the russian athletes who have been disqualified by the i.o.c., it is uncertain if all results from sochi will be finalized in time.        the russian olympic committee was also fined $15 million on tuesday, money that global officials said will be put toward drug-testing international athletes.  [read the times’s report that  first laid out  the details of russia’s doping scheme, and the exclusive story of a whistle-blower’s  personal diaries  that were shared with investigators.]  the punishment announced tuesday resembles what antidoping regulators had  lobbied for  leading up to the 2016 summer games, where russia was allowed to participate but in  restricted numbers . it is likely to face a legal appeal from russia’s olympic committee.  the decision was announced after top international olympic committee officials had met privately with mr. zhukov; vitaly smirnov, russia’s former sports minister who was last year appointed mr. putin to lead a national antidoping commission to redeem russia’s standing in global sports; and evgenia medvedeva, a two-time world skating champion.  “everyone is talking about how to punish russia, but no one is talking about how to help russia,” mr. smirnov said, sipping a hot beverage in the lobby of the lausanne palace hotel before delivering his final appeal to officials. “of course we want our athletes there, and we want the russian flag and anthem,” he said.        that appeal was rejected in light of the conclusions of samuel schmid, a former president of switzerland whom the olympic committee appointed last year to review the findings of a  scathing investigation  commissioned by the world anti-doping agency.            athletes who were denied their olympic medal moments because others were doping  when an olympic medalist is caught doping, any medals he or she has won are usually ordered returned, to be awarded to the next finisher in line.       “the analysis is clear and water-tight,” mr. schmid said tuesday. in a 30-page  report , he affirmed the credibility of whistle-blowers and investigators who had followed their leads and evidence.  tuesday’s penalty was in line with what had been  advocated  by two key whistle-blowers whose accounts upended russia’s standing in global sports over the last several years and were cited in mr. schmid’s report: grigory rodchenkov, the chemist who spent 10 years as russia’s antidoping lab chief and was key to carrying out the cheating schemes in sochi; and vitaly stepanov, a former employee of russia’s antidoping agency who married a runner for russia’s national team and was the first to speak publicly about the nation’s institutionalized cheating.  “the world knows that hundreds of olympic dreams have been stolen by the doping system in the country where i was born,” mr. stepanov wrote in an affidavit submitted to the international olympic committee this fall. he had suggested banning russia’s olympic committee for two years, or until the nation’s antidoping operations are recertified by regulators. russia and its individual athletes are all but certain to miss the 2018 paralympics given regulators’  refusal to recertify  the nation last month.  “the evidence is clear, that the doping system in russia has not yet been truly reformed,” mr. stepanov wrote.  dr. rodchenkov is living in an undisclosed location in the united states under protection of federal authorities. in august, “icarus,” a film detailing dr. rodchenkov’s move to the united states and tell-all account, was released. in addition to sworn testimony and forensic evidence, mr. schmid cited the film as further evidence in his report.  “russia’s consistent denials lack any credibility, and its failure to produce all evidence in its possession only further confirms its high-level complicity,” jim walden, a lawyer for dr. rodchenkov, said tuesday. the russian sports ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.        tuesday’s decision could have consequences for another major sports event scheduled to be held in russia, next year’s $11 billion soccer world cup. the nation’s deputy prime minister, vitaly mutko, was russia’s top sports official during the 2014 sochi games and was  directly implicated  by dr. rodchenkov. as part of tuesday’s ruling, mr. mutko was barred for life from the olympics.  mr. mutko is also the chairman of the local organizing committee for the world cup, but fifa said in a statement tuesday that the i.o.c.’s punishments for olympic doping would have “no impact” on its preparations for the tournament, which begins in june.

       " \"the olympic motto may be “higher, faster, stronger.” but the way the 2018 pyeongchang games have transpired it may as well be meh, nah, really?  with only a couple of days left, the united states’ medal count of 21 is behind the 28 it won in the 2014 sochi games. nbc’s prime-time ratings are down, too, about 16 percent from four years ago, though according to  total audience delivery , nbc’s preferred measuring stick and the one it used to sell ads for the games, viewership is only down 8 percent over all.   but another barometer could be telling, too, of the olympics’ popularity: most of the viral hits online from the games, according to data from twitter, instagram, facebook and crowdtangle, an analytics tool owned by facebook, have little to do with athletic achievement. these heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the olympics but now spread to a wider audience.  of the accounts that crowdtangle tracks, some of the top facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from feb. 9 to 21 included  memes  (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized  drones  from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman “practicing” the sport of  curling with a roomba  and two trailers for “ the incredibles 2 ,” which premiered during the games.            while the roomba curler did indeed “ hurry hard ,” here are the other olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they

his alarm the day of his gold medal run. he called his morning “hectic.”         after winning the gold, he promptly let out an expletive heard on television. the internet found its first hero of the

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — russia failed in an 11th hour attempt to overturn a ban against 47 athletes and coaches from participating at the 2018 winter games on friday, saving the international olympic committee from welcoming individuals it had judged to be tainted by the most elaborate doping program in sports history.  the decision, delivered by the secretary general of the court of arbitration for sport at a packed news conference, just hours before the opening ceremony, allowed the i.o.c. a reprieve from the legal disputes and welter of criticism linked to the russia’s doping scandal.  the court essentially ruled that the i.o.c. had the right to decide which russian athletes it could invite because it had already banned the country’s olympic committee in december for its yearslong doping program that had corrupted several winter and summer games.  russia has continued to deny that it operated the doping program, whose tentacles reached to the highest levels of russian sport, according to investigators. the panel agreed.        “this panel is faced with evaluating an unprecedented response to an extraordinary situation, that is, a state-sponsored doping scheme,” the panel said.  matthieu reeb, the court’s secretary general, said the applicants did not demonstrate that the manner of two special commissions established to determine eligibility for the games was carried out “in a discriminatory, arbitrary or unfair manner.”  russia’s deputy prime minister vitaly mutko, who is serving a life ban from the olympics for his role in the scandal, said: “this decision could not have been different. the inviting formula is extremely difficult to challenge, regardless of whether violations existed. the procedure itself is not transparent and does not contribute to the authority of the organization in the fans’ opinion.”  he compared the invitation process to a “commercial private club tournament,” adding, “this all will diminish competition and attention to the games.”  victory for the russian contingent, which included viktor ahn, a short-track speedskater who has won six olympic gold medals, and anton shipulin, a biathlon world champion, would have damaged the credibility of i.o.c. president thomas bach. critics have accused bach of trying too hard to avoid alienating russia, which has been one of the most supportive and successful countries in international sports, at the expense of punishing the country for instituting the elaborate cheating scheme.        just days earlier bach had railed against the sports court for upholding the appeals of 28 russian athletes who an i.o.c. panel had said breached antidoping regulations at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia. that reversal paved the way for 15 individuals to join a claim by 32 others to be allowed to appear in pyeongchang.  after completing its own prolonged investigations that reiterated what an independent investigation revealed in 2016, the i.o.c. banned russian officials and athletes linked to the doping program but said it would allow individuals it deemed “clean” to participate as “olympic athletes from russia.” that group of almost 170 athletes is one of the largest contingents at pyeongchang.  “the fact the i.o.c. chose not to issue a blanket ban was a consequence of its efforts to reward clean athletes,” said stephen hess, chairman of the appeals tribunal for the international bobsled and skeleton federation.  tensions have been running high over the participation of the russian team. many athletes have expressed concerns about the possibility of competing against individuals linked to the clandestine doping scheme that involved the large scale swapping of drug tainted urine samples for clean ones. lowell bailey, an american biathlete and a reigning world champion, this week blamed the i.o.c. for creating uncertainty so close to the games. “i think that the timing of all this is ridiculous,” he said.  the i.o.c. didn’t elaborate on the verdict friday, issuing a 16-word statement shortly after it had been announced.  “we welcome this decision, which supports the fight against doping and brings clarity for all athletes,” it said.  in recent days, russian officials here had expressed confidence the court would rule in their favor.        “today is a great and historic day for russian sport: we can finally win in this story of doping,” a russian television journalist said in a live broadcast, standing just yards from the room where legal arguments were taking place thursday.  russia’s english language broadcaster rt took to twitter to post a video of an enormous russian flag beamed onto the front of building close to the canadian headquarters of the world anti doping agency. a slogan read: the russians are coming.  after making the announcement on behalf of the court, reeb had to be spirited away into a side room as russian journalists demanded to know why the three-person arbitration panel sided with the i.o.c.  “they didn’t make any violations of the antidoping rules. why are they not let into the olympic games?” one television reporter demanded to know. reeb smiled wanly before saying he couldn’t answer questions.  the case against russia was largely built on the testimony of the former head of its drug testing laboratory, grigory rodchenkov. rodchenkov, now living in hiding in the united states, detailed how he had formulated cocktails of banned substances to athletes and swapped the tainted samples under the direction of government officials. russia has branded him a traitor and issued an arrest warrant against him.  “i am confident that today’s decision is mostly a reaction to the outcry from clean athletes against olympic corruption and complicity,” rodchenkov’s lawyer jim walden said in a statement. “i hope i.o.c. president thomas bach is listening.”  the strain of the doping scandal was evident earlier this week at a meeting of the i.o.c.’s membership, when the usual chummy atmosphere briefly descended into accusations and recriminations when its longest-serving member, canada’s richard pound, said the organization was in trouble.        “i don’t think we can talk our way out of this problem,” pound said.  gerardo werthein, a member from argentina, lashed back at pound for being overly critical and discrediting the i.o.c.  officials are hoping that the focus will switch from doping to sports now that the final appeals by the russians are over.  “we want this relegated to page 17 of the newspapers when the sport starts — not on the front or back,” the world antidoping agency president craig reedie said.

       " 'evan strong has earned every title in adaptive snowboarding. he has a gold medal from the 2014 sochi paralympics, a silver medal from the 2018 pyeongchang paralympics, several world cup titles, world championship titles, and a handful of x game medals, too.  what more can a paralympian accomplish?  well, the olympics.  the 30-year-old strong, who just finished competing in pyeongchang, has spent the past six years working to become the first paralympic snowboarder to compete against able-bodied athletes in the winter olympics, something he hopes to accomplish at the 2022 beijing games.  “it’s all in the works,” he said before the 2018 paralympics. “after this games i’m going to focus full time on able-bodied racing and step away from adaptive racing for a couple years.”  strong grew up on maui and was well on his way to becoming a professional skateboarder when, at 17, he was riding his motorcycle and was hit head-on by a drunken driver. his left leg was partially amputated.        he learned to snowboard three years later, in 2007, and quickly rose through the ranks of adaptive snowboarding. in 2017, he  won a national title  competing against able-bodied athletes in colorado.  “being able to win an able-bodied national title in snowboard cross as someone with a prosthetic leg — it’s, like, almost as euphoric as winning a gold medal in the games in sochi,” he said.  strong would not be the first paralympic athlete to compete against able-bodied competitors.  oscar pistorius , the double-amputee and sprinter from south africa, competed in the 2012 olympic games. the international association of athletics federations initially barred pistorius from competing, saying pistorius’s blade prosthetics gave him an advantage. pistorius  prevailed in court in 2008 .  ten years later, the conclusions of that case  remain murky , however, and the scientific debate about whether the prosthetics offer a competitor some unfair advantage has never been fully settled.  when asked if strong could enter the snowboarding competitions, officials with the international ski federation, which oversees the sport, had to study their  rule book .        oliver kraus, a spokesman for f.i.s., said he was unable to find anything in the 171-page guide that would prevent strong from competing. but kraus pointed to rule 222, which states that all equipment used in competitions must conform to f.i.s. regulations. whether strong’s prosthetic will be evaluated as equipment remains to be seen.  “nuances come in with impairment,” said julie dussliere, the vice president of u.s. paralympics. when it comes to athletes with visual impairments, she said, “there’s no question whatsoever” that they can participate in able-bodied competitions. when equipment, prosthetics or otherwise, is required, questions arise.  much of the prosthetic technology that extreme athletes use is fairly new, and many recent advances in adaptive snowboarding came from mike schultz.  schultz was a professional snowmobile racer until 2008, when he sustained an injury during competition and had to have his leg amputated. when he returned to snowmobiling, he realized the available prosthetics were just too limiting. “so the wheels started turning, and i decided to design my own knee,” he said.  schultz founded  biodapt  ,  a prosthetic company in minnesota that now outfits the entire u.s. para snowboard team — which includes him. schultz won a silver medal in banked slalom in pyeongchang and a gold in snowboard cross in the sb-ll1 classification, for athletes who have significant impairment in one leg.  in pyeongchang, strong fell short of the repeat gold medal he was seeking. he finished the games with a fourth-place finish in snowboard cross and a silver medal in banked slalom under the sb-ll2, a classification for athletes with impairment in one or two legs, with less activity limitation.  to get to the olympic games, strong must change his schedule to focus on able-bodied events. he will need to rise through the ranks within the able-bodied divisions, from regionals to nationals to world cup events.        “the exciting thing is planting a seed and seeing how it spreads,” strong said, pointing to the flood of runners who went on to break the 4-minute mile barrier after  roger bannister first did so  in may 1954.  “if i could do it, i could give so many people with disabilities the permission to do the same or better than me,” strong said. “by the end of my career, it’d be nice to leave a legacy to have set a bar somewhere.”       ',\n",
       " 'despite hyperbolic language that russia had been barred from the 2018 winter olympics, in truth it may have gotten off fairly lightly for undermining the previous winter games, which it hosted, with systematic doping.  russian athletes will still be allowed to compete in february in south korea if they can show they have passed rigorous drug screening protocols. and they will wear uniforms that identify them as an “olympic athlete from russia” instead of as an independent athlete.  yes, the russian olympic committee has been suspended. and its athletes would not march under the russian flag at the opening ceremony or hear the russian anthem played if they win gold medals (they will hear the olympic anthem).  but the punishment would have been much harsher with a prohibition of all russian athletes.  the international olympic committee’s decision will be seen as more than fair in the international sports world. the committee penalized russia for its widespread doping program but kept the door open — perhaps widely — for athletes who could show they have been tested regularly and have not been caught using banned substances.        “the rights of the individual russian clean athletes need to be protected,” samuel schmid, a former president of switzerland who led a commission that examined the elaborate russian doping system, said at a news conference on tuesday.  some of the current top russian athletes seem unlikely to have been involved in the doping scheme at the 2014 winter games in the black sea resort of sochi, russia.  evgenia medvedeva, a teenager who is heavily favored to win the women’s figure skating competition at the 2018 games if she recovers from a foot injury, was only 14 at the time of the sochi games and did not participate in them.  “i don’t want younger athletes that have nothing to do with this to be penalized,” bruno marcotte, a prominent canadian figure skating coach, said in a recent interview. “but i want the truth to be exposed.”  still, by permitting compliant athletes to wear olympic uniforms identifying them as russians at the 2018 games, the i.o.c. went to great lengths in an attempt to avoid any call for a boycott, which presumably would come from russian president vladimir v. putin.        a spokesman for putin, dmitry peskov, told reporters before tuesday’s decision that a boycott was not being considered, despite some news media reports floating the possibility. leonid tygachev, the honorary president of the russian olympic committee, urged the country to permit its athletes to compete at the 2018 winter games, telling russian state television on tuesday that, for athletes who did not compete in sochi, “let them compete clean and show that we’re from russia and we’re not pariahs.”  alexander zhukov, the president of russia’s olympic committee, speaking to reporters in lausanne, switzerland, after the decision, said russia would discuss its participation but that the i.o.c.’s willingness to identify athletes as russians and not neutrals was “very important.”  how these athletes react, and how to determine which of them would go, will ultimately help determine just how sweeping the i.o.c. move really is.  medvedeva, the figure skater who also traveled to lausanne to help plead russia’s case, declined to say whether she would compete at the games under conditions prescribed by the i.o.c.  “it will be discussed more and it’s very early to ask questions like that,” she told reporters.  the i.o.c. said a specialized panel will screen russian athletes seeking to compete in south korea. the criteria include not having any previous doping violations, agreeing to undergo pre-games testing and complying with any other testing the panel imposes.  yet even with this panel, the i.o.c. will face an uncomfortable truth: it is almost impossible to know whether an athlete is truly “clean” of using banned substances.  given the sophistication of drug use, with micro-dosing techniques that go undetected, those athletes who are doping often remain one step ahead of experts policing them.        it will mean almost nothing that a particular athlete from russia — or any other country — has passed a series of drug screenings, as we have learned in past scandals, including those involving the cyclist lance armstrong and the sprinter marion jones.  these days, the i.o.c. has often been reduced to embarrassing retrospection, taking medals away from athletes and rewarding them to others years after a particular olympics ends, when urine samples are retested for prohibited substances by more sophisticated technology (there will be a ceremony in south korea to award such medals).  revelations about the state-sponsored east german system of the 1970s and 1980s did not deter widespread use of banned substances. neither did a gold medal stripped from ben johnson, the canadian sprinter who tested positive for steroids after winning the 100 meters at the 1988 summer olympics in seoul, south korea. nor did the discrediting of jones, who won five medals at the 2000 sydney olympics.  the i.o.c. has been widely criticized for indifference toward doping through the years. and few experts expect the russian scandal to be much of a deterrent, either.  “it’s difficult to assume that one major punishment will stop this age-old practice from continuing,” said scott minto, the director of the sports master’s in business program at san diego state university.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea concluded with a rousing, rocking closing ceremony. here’s a look at what happened:  the 2018 olympics end with a dance party  the last 15 minutes of the ceremony were listed as an electronic dance music party. the djs cranking loud music included raiden (not the mortal kombat character), and martin garrix, the dutch superstar of the scene. the athletes streamed out of the stands onto the floor and many of them danced. the american skiing superstar lindsey vonn led a conga line. a fun and unregimented way to end things. that wraps up the closing ceremony, and the 2018 winter olympics. annyeong from pyeongchang!            image      credit  hilary swift for the new york times

ceremony also turned up for a cameo. they opened up a giant present that revealed a snow globe. sports scenes were projected, an advertisement for the i.o.c.’s olympics channel.        in the next segment, 400 performers entered carrying led balls. lights cascaded up to the olympic flame and “extinguished” it. the performers took the shape of a snowflake to complete the effect.            image

committee, and thomas bach, olympic champion in fencing (mentioned for the third time).        bach spoke directly to north and south korea. “you have shown how sport brings people together in our very fragile world, you have shown how sport builds bridges.”  as a little thrill to shake up the torpor of the speeches, several well-known athletes, including lindsey vonn and pita taufatofua, the tongan taekwondo olympian who competed in cross-country skiing and appeared shirtless and well-oiled for the fourth consecutive olympic ceremony, posed with bach and made a heart gesture with their hands.            image         credit  doug mills/the new york times             image         credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         beijing 2022 takes the stage  skaters scooted around the

the olympic anthem. the olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of beijing, host of the 2022 games. the national anthem of china. and that meant it was time for a segment devoted to beijing. yes, with pandas!            image         credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         visual spectacle and some math  next a somewhat abstract look at time. some base 60 numbers were

world no longer bound by gravity.” and “the axis of new time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.” thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.            image        norway’s marit bjoergen celebrates her gold medal.   credit  chang

who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. the puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death.

each nation carried by one of its own olympic heroes. except for russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the games. ester ledecka (czech republic), jessie diggins (u.s.), marit bjoergen (norway), ireen wust (netherlands) and javier fernandez (spain) are among those who earned the honor.  and then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. this entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other olympics it has often gone on much longer. there were a record 2,920 athletes at these games.        the canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. they had their best winter olympics performance ever — winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. you’ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. many athletes — and most of the biggest name athletes — travel back home after their events. but the last event of the olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. so if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon’s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.            image         credit  chang w. lee/the new york times             image         credit  hilary swift for the new york times             image         credit  chang w. lee/the

suits cavorted. eighty traditional korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock — the meeting of old and new. a prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening

       " 'tampa, fla. — over the past two decades, the n.h.l.’s best players have been participants in the winter olympics. but this year, they will have a new role when the olympic men’s hockey tournament begins feb. 14: they will be fans.  citing injury concerns, costs and what it called a lack of tangible benefit, the n.h.l. decided not to schedule its customary three-week olympic break or  loan its clubs’ players for the winter games  in pyeongchang, south korea.  for many players at last weekend’s all-star festivities here, the disappointment over being unable to participate has lingered, and it is only starting to give way to a mix of national pride, curiosity and support of friends.  “when it all came out, i was pretty angry that we weren’t going to be going, so i told myself that i’m probably not going to watch the olympics,” said dallas stars forward tyler seguin, who most likely would have been on the canadian olympic team for the first time. “now as it’s getting closer, i’m realizing that i’m still proud to be canadian and i am going to watch. but, obviously, it’s going to be pretty bittersweet.”        penguins center sidney crosby, who scored the gold medal-winning goal for canada at the vancouver games in 2010, said he had moved on from his frustration to focus on the tasks at hand in pittsburgh.  “you just kind of turn the page and follow like everyone else,” said crosby, though he added he would be “glued to the tv for two weeks” during the olympics.  crosby’s foil, washington wing alex ovechkin, has not been so accepting. he was vocal about his dismay after the decision was announced, and talked about leaving the capitals to join the russian delegation.  during all-star weekend, ovechkin shifted between forlornness and irritability. on saturday, he said some of his most cherished memories were of the olympics. on sunday, he was dismissive. “olympics is not my question right now,” he said. “i’m just a fan right now.”  nashville predators defenseman p.k. subban and edmonton oilers center connor mcdavid, both canadians, have found some intrigue in the tournament.        “you forget sometimes how good the n.h.l. is, and you realize that when you see how many great players aren’t playing in the n.h.l.,” subban said.  mcdavid, 21, the league’s reigning most valuable player and scoring champion, will be missing out on what would have been his first olympics. he could not help but think of what could have been, he said, considering the depth of talent around the world.  “you look at the states, they would have had kane, eichel, matthews,” mcdavid said, referring to patrick kane, jack eichel and auston matthews. “canada could have put together a pretty special team as well. sweden, finland, you name it. the game is just at a good point.”  kane, a chicago blackhawks right wing, expressed hope that a talented american side could come together in the future. until then, he said he’d support the group of collegians, former n.h.l. players and pros playing overseas who will represent the united states in south korea.            image     rangers goalie henrik lundqvist will not represent sweden at the olympics, but his twin brother, joel, will.   credit  bruce bennett/getty images         “i think it’s cool for a lot of these guys that maybe lost their way in hockey and all of a sudden they get a second chance, or some guys who never really got that chance are getting that chance now,” kane said.  colorado avalanche forward nathan mackinnon, a canadian, said half a dozen 2018 olympians had recently passed through the colorado system, and he counted all of them as friends. johnny gaudreau, an american, said he’d be rooting for the united states but also for his former teammate mason raymond, who plays professionally in switzerland and will compete for canada.        for others, it is a family affair. pekka rinne, a finnish goalie for nashville, will be cheering on his brother-in-law, mika pyorala, a forward for finland. rangers goalie henrik lundqvist’s twin brother, joel, will be a forward on the swedish team, as he has on many occasions, including when  he and henrik won the gold medal  at the world championships last year.  “he’s super excited to go,” henrik lundqvist said. “he’s played for the national team so many times in different formats, but this will be his first olympics.”  lundqvist, san jose sharks defenseman brent burns and others lamented missing the opportunity to travel to south korea, a place many of them have never been.  crosby expressed hope that the n.h.l. would participate in the 2022 games in china. commissioner gary bettman declined to comment on the possibility at a news conference on saturday.  ottawa senators defenseman erik karlsson, a swede, said his own absence from the olympics and that of his peers would not curb his enthusiasm for the event.  “i’ve been watching the olympics since i was a little kid,” he said. “it’s something that i always enjoyed watching whether it’s the winter or the summer. i’ll be following it closely even though it’s unfortunate that we won’t be there.”  los angeles kings center anze kopitar, the only active slovenian player in the n.h.l., has deep connections to his national team, but he said he probably would not be staying up late to catch games on tv. he said commitments to the kings and his children would take precedence over paying attention to the olympics.        but vegas golden knights goalie marc-andre fleury, a former canadian olympian, was undaunted by the 17-hour time difference between nevada and south korea.  “i’ll be watching for sure,” he said. “it’s tough with the time zone change and games on in the middle of the night. but hey, we’ve got dvr. i’m sure there will be a few bets in the room and it will be fun to keep track of it.”  for some, even talking about the olympics was not so fun. even the tampa bay lightning captain steven stamkos, who had been a smiling, accommodating host during all-star weekend, grew stern when asked how closely he would follow the olympic tournament.  “if we’re not playing and if it’s on, maybe i’ll catch a game,” he said.  stamkos, who could not play on the canadian team at the 2014 games because of a broken leg, said players were still very disappointed and angry, and that many would not be watching for that reason.  “that’s not to say you won’t support your country, you absolutely are,” he said, “but there’s still a pretty sour taste in everyone’s mouths about that whole situation.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — shortly after 11 a.m. for the last several days, sung baik-yoo, the chief spokesman for the organizers of the 2018 winter olympics, has leaned into a microphone at a news conference and provided a ticket sales update. the news is always a little more positive than the day before.  by thursday, sung said organizers were within one percent of their target of 90 percent sold out, a figure that equals about one million tickets sold. yet the scene at venues here in pyeongchang, south korea, from the ski slopes in the mountain cluster to the ice sports stadiums of olympic park, tells a story far different from sung’s pronouncements of success.  swaths of empty blue seats have been a familiar backdrop despite organizers’ efforts to fill in gaps by providing volunteers with so-called passion tickets that allow them to attend events and by bringing in school groups by the busload.  so far, fans have been able to show up right before the start of all but the most popular events and buy a ticket.        peter skinner, an australian who traveled to the games from his home in bangkok, said he regretted purchasing tickets months before the games started.  “we’re never again buying tickets in advance,” said skinner, as he walked with his wife toward the hockey arena for the first session of the men’s competition. one event they had been looking forward to, the men’s downhill, was postponed along with several other skiing events because of bad weather. they headed to figure skating instead.            image     the biathlon did not appear to be a big draw at the pyeongchang games, as these empty seats at the alpine biathlon centre show.     credit  hilary swift for the new york times         “it’s sad, it’s half empty,” he said of the sparse attendance he had seen.  it is not just the spectators who have noticed. aksel lund svindal of norway described completing his gold medal run in the men’s downhill on thursday in front of a mostly empty grandstand as “a little bit strange.”  the low attendance may be partly attributed to the fact that south korea does not have a culture of alpine sports. it has achieved winter olympic success in just two events, speedskating and figure skating.        at some games in other countries, locals have packed venues to watch unfamiliar sports just to be a part of the experience. that has not happened here. a near-capacity crowd watched the short-track speedskater lim hyo-jun secure south korea’s first gold medal on saturday, but less popular events are taking place in front of blocks of empty seats.  “if we had this race in italy, austria, norway, sweden, it would be packed with 50,000 people,” svindal said. to be fair, he said, he doubted people in norway would fill an arena for short-track speedskating, like they did here, but he still wished he had won his medal amid a more raucous atmosphere. “it’s a bit sad.”  empty seats are not a problem unique to the pyeongchang games. organizers of the last two olympics — in rio de janeiro in 2016 and sochi two years earlier — also found themselves under scrutiny as images of half-empty venues were beamed worldwide.  unused seats reserved for sponsors and athletes were blamed then. organizers are doing the same here. “we find they are the empty seats,” said a spokeswoman for pyeongchang 2018, though it is unlikely that is the lone explanation. organizers continue to advertise the games and are actively encouraging fans to buy tickets on-site.            image        athletes are noticing the empty seats, such as these at the jeongseon alpine centre, and puzzling over it.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         heightened political tension between north korea and the united states in the buildup to the games did not help sales. less than six months before the games opened, president trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on north korea in response to a spate of missile tests by the north. the heavily armed border separating the koreas  is about 40 miles    from the olympic park .  occasional ticketing and transportation mix-ups have also caused venues to fill up only after events in them have started.        a women’s hockey game on wednesday between a joint korean team and japan was well into the first period when one ticketholder, jewell hatton from pennsylvania, said an attendant stopped her and told her that her ticket was invalid. organizers had reassigned her seat, and new arrangements would have to be made.  “that happened last night, too,” hatton said.  organizers said some tickets had to be reissued because of additional space required by broadcasters.  groups of south korean schoolchildren have been a common sight, bused in for field trips as part of a program by the ministry of education to educate young koreans about winter sports.  they also fill empty seats quite nicely. at a recent hockey game, a group of schoolchildren hungrily snapped photographs of the all-women cheerleading troupe from north korea.  a program is also in place for olympic volunteers to take up unoccupied seats. they are required to remove their uniforms so they are not identifiable, and they are obligated to move should a paying spectator show up.  “we also hope that this will help to increase the stadium’s atmosphere, so that athletes can perform their best,” a spokesman for pyeongchang 2018 said.        some foreign fans who have found limited transportation options are also rethinking whether to attend late-night sessions. organizers run buses to central hubs, but after that, fans are largely on their own amid the freezing temperatures.  “i’ve had to call the guy who owns the hotel near where we are staying to come and pick me up,” said skinner, the australian from bangkok. he said he had seen other spectators ask volunteers — and even police officers — for rides.  he is staying about three miles from the venues — close compared with some fans. but, he added, “it’s a long way to walk when it’s minus 15.”  at least one athlete saw the relative quiet as a silver lining. laura dahlmeier, a german biathlete, said that she needs to be able to concentrate as she fires her rifle at the target.  “i prefer this to when 50,000 people are screaming,” she said.

       " 'at the winter olympics, many gold medals are earned in the air. generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.   new york times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the pyeongchang games. here’s a look at some of their favorites photos.             image     jamie anderson of the united states won silver in snowboard big air on thursday morning.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         in the newest olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. the sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. it’s called big air for a reason.             jamie anderson of the united states won the silver medal. earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.             image        shaun white competing at the pyeongchang winter olympics.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         halfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. while traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail    — sometimes over 20 feet above the rim — to perform a variety of tricks. they are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.      american  shaun white won his third gold  in the halfpipe. his third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. trust us, that’s really hard.             image        cassie sharpe of canada won the gold in ski halfpipe.    credit  doug mills/the new york times         halfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. so these athletes don’t need to just get themselves in the air. to win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.        canada’s cassie sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.            image        yuzuru hanyu during his free skate. in this program, he scored second behind nathan chen of the united states. he scored a 317.85 in total, and was able to defend his olympic title.   credit  margaret cheatham williams/the new york times         for a figure skater to earn a spot on the podium, they need to rise above the ice. each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.   japanese gold medalist  yuzuru hanyu  performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.             image        alina zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women’s skating competition at the pyeongchang games.   credit  james hill for the new york times         russian gold medalist  alina zagitova  successfully landed a triple lutz — triple loop combination in both her short and long program.             image        lindsey vonn of the united states hits a jump during her run at the jeongseon alpine center in pyeongchang, south korea. vonn finished 6th.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         no one can compete with the airborne speed of downhill skiers at the olympics.    to reach the bottom of the hill first, they must navigate jumps quickly and smoothly. that means being airborne at some 80 miles per hour and landing safely, only to make a turn and do it again.

       " 'vancouver, british columbia — with a full-time job at the vancouver police department, meghan agosta could easily have decided to retire from hockey this year, at age 31. instead agosta, a star forward on the canadian national team, remains determined to return for her fifth winter olympics, in beijing in 2022.  “we were roommates at the olympics, and i said to her: ‘how does it feel? is this going to be your last?’ ” said laura fortino, a defender who made the most recent olympic all-star team at the pyeongchang games in february. “she looked at me dead straight in the face and said: ‘you know what? i’m not ready. this is not my last.’  “knowing gus, she is so determined. i know she will come back and play in beijing.”  agosta, who has three olympic gold medals, took the last shootout shot in the final against the united states in south korea. when the american goalie maddie rooney stopped the five-hole attempt, it ended canada’s reign as the four-time champion and gave the united states its first title since the inaugural olympic women’s hockey tournament in 1998.  despite her ultracompetitive nature, agosta handled the defeat with the kind of composure required in her law enforcement career in vancouver, where she regularly faces life-or-death situations.        “i’ve only been on the job for three and a half years, but i’ve seen basically everything,” agosta said. “they say as a police officer, you have a front-row seat to the best show in town. you leave some of the calls and you just shake your head: ‘did that really happen?’  “i’ve been to homicides, suicides, domestic complaints. my mind-set and perspective on life has changed drastically since i’ve become a police officer. you really have to enjoy the moments you have, especially playing for team canada.”          agosta will complete a hat trick of major life challenges in 2018 when she gives birth to her first child, a girl, in december. she is already raising two stepsons with jason robillard, her fiancé. robillard is a vancouver police sergeant.  “we’re very happy to say that we’re starting a family of our own and having a little baby girl,” agosta said. “hopefully she’ll follow in my footsteps someday!”        it is remarkable that this native of ruthven, ontario, was able to make the 2018 olympic team, and that assessment is not a reflection of her talent. a former mercyhurst university captain, who graduated with a criminal justice degree and a minor in criminalistics psychology, agosta is the n.c.a.a. career leader in goals (157) and points (303). she won canadian women’s hockey league scoring titles with the montreal stars in 2012 and 2013.  however, since agosta moved to british columbia in 2014, she has not trained or played with other top female players, except when the national team convenes. the last local professional women’s team, the vancouver griffins, folded in 2003.  agosta has found alternatives, such as playing for the vancouver police department’s team, practicing with a local midget aaa team of boys ages 15 to 17, and training with a skills coach at the university of british columbia.  “she’s always been self-motivated and driven, but i think her true colors came out when she decided to take on this full-time job,” fortino said. “she’s kind of on her own little island there in vancouver. she has no choice but to find ice and practice her skills and train in the gym by herself.”            image     meghan agosta, right, of canada, playing against the united states in the gold medal game at the sochi olympics in 2014. canada won that year, but lost the 2018 final to the united states. agosta hopes to play in her fifth olympics in 2022.   credit  james hill for the new york times         agosta, who missed the 2015 international ice hockey federation world championship in sweden to pursue policing, initially felt trepidation about her bold career move.  “i was starting police academy in september 2014,” agosta said. “i thought, ‘oh man, now i’ve got to tell hockey canada that i need to take the year off.’ that was my biggest fear. but hockey canada supported me: ‘it’s not like you’re going to go tour the world. we know that this is the career choice you wanted.’ i’ve been very fortunate.”        she has had to sandwich her training between policing shifts, four days off and then four days on. her shifts vary, typically running 11 or 12 hours and often keeping her up all night. that routine rivals the jet lag she might face when traveling with the national hockey team. currently, because of her pregnancy, she is working a desk job four days a week with the vancouver police department’s major crime section.  “eating, sleeping and training at different times is part of the challenge for me,” agosta said. “the quote i would use is ‘improvise, adapt and overcome.’ just have that belief and the positive mind-set that this is tough, but i still have a lot more to give.”  in her limited recovery time, agosta’s pleasures are simple. she drinks coffee, watches “the bachelor” and walks her dog, rocky, with her family in their south surrey neighborhood.  somehow, it works. finland’s noora raty, named the best goalie at the 2018 olympics, attests to agosta’s prowess.  “meghan is one of the most dangerous players i’ve ever played against because of her high hockey i.q.,” raty said in an email. “she is a constant scoring threat because of her speed, poise with the puck and quick snap shot, which is hard to read as a goalie. she is just a complete, all-around player who can play in all three zones.”  agosta is also a dressing room leader. recalling her experiences before the 2006 olympics in turin, italy, she preaches a gratitude-based, go-for-it attitude to her teammates.  “i was 18 and our oldest player, danielle goyette, was 40,” agosta said. “i was in awe: ‘holy crow! i’m in the dressing room with all my childhood heroes.’ coach mel davidson pulled me aside two months in and said: ‘listen, you’re here for a reason. you need to start performing. if not, we’re going to have to release you.’ i thought, ‘i have nothing to lose.’ that’s when i changed how i was playing.”        agosta, long focused on the rivalry between canada and the united states, will be unavailable to play for canada at the 2019 world championship in espoo, finland, in april; she should be quite busy with a baby girl by then.  agosta informed her canadian teammates via the messaging app whatsapp that she would sit out the world championship, but she plans to get back in shape for the team’s annual fitness testing in may 2019. she continued to hit the gym this summer but stayed off the ice, apart from running her hockey school in ontario in late august.  for a veteran athlete like agosta, who chose hockey over figure skating at age 6, international tournaments still represent the pinnacle. the united states has won seven of the last eight world championships. canada last prevailed in 2012.  “it’s not about which line you play on or which power-play unit,” agosta said. “it’s about being there and being part of the team. my perspective on hockey has changed, just living in the moment, taking each opportunity and going with it. so many young girls would love to be in this position.”       ',\n",
       " 'gangneung, south korea — nominally, russia is barred from the winter olympics, but that was not obvious at the team figure skating event on sunday as a cheering section waved the russian flag and wore ponchos and hockey jerseys in the red, white and blue of the russian tricolor and shirts and hats that said “russia in my heart.”  if there is any enmity toward the russians for a state-backed system of doping that operated at the 2014 winter olympics, it does not appear evident, at least publicly, in this most visible and closely followed of sports at the games.  the audience clapped politely on sunday, and there seemed to be no booing. after  the final round on monday , the team of russians won silver behind canada, which took the gold medal. the united states claimed the bronze.        “we felt like at home,” the russian ice dancer dmitri soloviev said. “we felt that every person sitting in each corner of the stadium was yelling the name of russia.”            image     russian fans cheered for medvedeva, a gold medal favorite in the women&rsquo;s singles competition next week.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         russia had won its first medal of these games on saturday as semen elistratov took a bronze in short-track speedskating and dedicated his podium finish to “all guys that have been excluded from these games in such a hard and unfair way.”  figure skating is a much more established and celebrated sport. no country has won more olympic skating medals than the former soviet union and russia. and no sport other than hockey ratifies russia’s history of dominant achievement at the winter games.  strictly speaking, the silver medal in the team skating competition was awarded to a neutral contingent of “olympic athletes from russia,” and five-ringed olympic flag would be raised in the medal ceremony, not russia’s.  but that is widely considered a mere technicality.  “everyone will know they are russians if they have a flag or not,” said rafael arutyunyan, a georgian who coached in moscow for nearly two decades and now coaches the american olympians nathan chen and adam rippon.              russia was barred from these games as punishment for systematic doping while playing host to the 2014 winter olympics in sochi, the black sea resort. but 169 individual russian athletes have been permitted to compete after passing what were said to be rigorous drug screenings.  figure skating has not been immune to the doping scandal. two prominent russian skaters, including ksenia stolbova, who won silver and gold medals in pairs at the 2014 games, have been prohibited from these olympics for reasons that have not been fully explained.  even those who were permitted to compete here nervously awaited clearance.  “we didn’t know until the day before the olympics whether we would go or not,” said ekaterina bobrova, soloviev’s ice dance partner. “of course this was difficult for us.”  yet there is seemingly little or no ostracism of the russian skaters here. they compete regularly on an international circuit, are well known and highly regarded and lend competitive rigor to any skating event. their absence would lessen the outcome in the view of many in the sport.            image        natalia zabiiako and alexander enbert competing sunday. russia was barred from the games as punishment for systematic doping while playing host to the 2014 olympics.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         “if you’re at the olympics, you want to be with the best people in the world,” said denise myers, the coach of the american women’s champion bradie tennell.        stéphane lambiel, the 2006 olympic silver medalist from switzerland who is now a coach, said the russian skaters were being welcomed. “yes, for sure they are,” lambiel said. “they are great athletes, and they are working hard. they’re amazing. i’m the first fan of the russian school.”  the canadian olympic committee apologized several days ago for an incident in which a russian coach said a canadian delegate had verbally abused him in the olympic village about the participation of russian athletes. on sunday, michael slipchuk, the leader of the canadian skating team, said none of his skating personnel had been involved.  “it definitely wasn’t ours, and if it was, we wouldn’t appreciate it,” slipchuk said.  because this is a sport of costumes, not uniforms, russia’s skaters are not competing like the country’s other athletes in a sporting version of a scarlet letter — drab neutral outfits that say “olympic athlete from russia.”            image        the russian ice dancers dmitri soloviev and ekaterina bobrova. the audience clapped politely on sunday, and there seemed to be no booing.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         and if athletes cannot display the russian flag, the fans are under no such restriction. more than 100 of them cheered on the russian skaters on sunday. about two dozen russian flags were held aloft.  “i’m proud of my country,” said nikita ivanov, 21, a student from st. petersburg who rooted on the skaters. “we can do a lot in these olympic games and win a lot of medals in a lot of sports.”  there was also socializing to be done here at the russia house — well, officially, the “ sports house ” — where one can find a buffet, the costume worn by adelina sotnikova to win the 2014 olympic women’s skating competition and, of course, photographs of president vladimir v. putin.        evgenia medvedeva, 18, a two-time world skating champion and a gold medal favorite in the women’s singles competition next week, won the short program in sunday’s team competition.  in december, she helped plead russia’s case before the international olympic committee, which resulted in less than a full ban of the country’s athletes. asked if she thought her words had made a difference, medvedeva said on sunday, “i can’t say so with confidence, but i really tried to do everything i was able to do, and i hope it goes better for our team.”  still, not all of russia’s top skaters are here. and their absence has elicited sympathy from the skating community. if there was systematic doping in russia, said arutyunyan, the coach of chen, it was surely orchestrated by officials, not athletes.  “i feel sadness for athletes because they cannot compete for the country they represent, and basically it’s not their fault,” he said.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — they wave huge “red machine” banners. they paint the country’s tricolor flag on their faces or stencil it in their hair. they cheer in clusters, wearing matching shirts and scarves, chanting “roo-see-yaa!” in unison.  swarms of russian supporters have descended on the pyeongchang games, offering an emphatic answer to anyone who wondered if they were embarrassed or cowed by doping allegations that have kept scores of their athletes out of the games.  nyet. nyet. a thousand times, nyet.  “our athletes, they are like any other athletes,” said viacheslav shkarin, a resident of vladivostok, russia, who was wearing a tall, furry white hat called a papakha on sunday night at the alpensia biathlon centre. “we think what has happened here is very unfair. we’re angry.”  they are also disappointed by the performance of russian athletes, who had yet to win a single gold medal entering wednesday’s events. eleven days into the 2014 sochi olympics, russia had won five gold medals and 18 over all. through tuesday, russian athletes in south korea had zero gold medals and 11 over all.        but good luck finding any russian fans who blame their athletes or the government. instead, they blame the international olympic committee, the organization that barred their best competitors and that they consider both corrupt and capricious.  a few fans will concede that some of their athletes  might have been doping . but more than 160? they want evidence. they want explanations. the testimony of the former head of moscow’s antidoping lab, and the results of two independent investigations, one for the world anti-doping agency and another for the i.o.c., do not convince them.            image     russian athletes after winning the silver medal in free-dance team skating on feb. 12. by this point at the 2014 sochi games, russian athletes had won far more medals.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         “they tell us nothing,” andrey savinov, a 53-year-old muscovite, said while waiting for the start of the biathlon, a sport in which russia had doping problems long before 2014. “they have explained nothing.”  savinov and his compatriots have come to support a team officially known as olympic athletes from russia, in a games where both the russian flag and the russian anthem have been prohibited, at least from the field of play.        these and other restrictions were imposed after an investigation determined that russia ran what is arguably  the most ambitious cheating conspiracy in sports history : a state-sponsored program to provide athletes with performance-enhancing drugs, coupled with elaborate countermeasures to beat urine tests. russia’s president, vladimir v. putin, has denied that the state-sponsored program was in place.  the efforts produced striking results at the sochi games, where russia won a total of 29 medals, 11 of them gold, the most of any country. (four of those medals were ultimately stripped over doping violations.)  the meager haul this year does not surprise russians because so many of their greatest contenders are not contending. for this, most of the opprobrium is directed at the i.o.c., but some think that the united states is somewhat culpable, too.  “who is the biggest sponsor of the games?” asked savinov, a former international speedskater. “it’s nbc. they pay billions of dollars for the rights to broadcast.”  like a lot of russian fans, savinov was dressed to billboard his indignation. he wore a sochi 2014 winter hat and a bright white and red jacket with “r u” on the front. on a sleeve was a patch that read “russian olympic team.” not far away, a woman waved a huge russia-themed flag with a bear on it.  the russian flag is an object the athletes are careful to avoid. the hockey star ilya kovalchuk has reportedly asked flag-bearing fans who want a selfie to, at least momentarily, hide the flag. the athletes from russia had to agree not to register any protests. even a selfie with a flag in it could be construed as dissent.        there are no such restrictions in the stands, of course, and, other than the south koreans, russian fans might be the most visible cohort here. it is difficult to discern whether these russians are here as true “fans” or whether they are part of sponsored group that has been sent here — by the government, or the collection of oligarchs who support olympic sports — to stick up for the country and wave banners in a language that is not their own. regardless, for sheer enthusiasm, their only rivals are the norwegians, who are avid face painters with access to an apparently limitless supply of plastic viking helmets.  they are not nearly as loud as the russians, however. at the hockey game against the united states on saturday, russian fans camped in a mass of blue and red behind both nets. many sported stickers and hats that read “russia in my heart,” a phrase that became a rallying cry of sorts of a few months ago, as it became clear that “russia” would not appear in the olympics. they sang russian folk songs. they screamed “russia, forward!”  they also erupted at each goal into a hopping, joyful horde. their side won, 4-0, so they had plenty to hop about.  by contrast, there was not a single russian who qualified for the men’s 15-kilometer mass start biathlon. the country’s best prospect, anton shipulin, was among a few dozen athletes whose appeal for admission to the olympics  was denied just as the games began . he had been training right up to the final decision, skiing with his cellphone in his pocket and hoping for a text message with some good news, according to the british publication  express .  it never came. russian fans showed up at the race anyway, falling into a distinctly foul mood when talk turned to the event.  “why isn’t shipulin here?” said shkarin, the white-hatted fan from vladivostok. “why?”  once his pique had passed, he pivoted to a note of optimism.  “i love the olympics,” he said. “i’m really looking forward to the 2022 games in beijing.”       ',\n",
       " 'gangneung, south korea — victoria moiseeva, in a high-stakes match, found it impossible to push a brewing scandal out of her mind on monday morning at gangneung curling centre. it was the first time in her life, she said, that she could not fully focus while competing.  “it’s a catastrophe,” she said.  moiseeva, the skip, or head curler, of the russian women’s team was referring to the possible effects of  a failed doping test by a fellow russian curler  here at the 2018 winter olympics.  she and some other russian athletes fretted that the damage from this single case could be widespread.  “this is simply terrifying to think about,” she said.  the athlete, alexander krushelnytsky, is the first from russia to come under investigation at these games for using a banned substance, jeopardizing the bronze medal he won last week in the mixed doubles competition with his wife. it also complicates russia’s effort to rehabilitate its image after a vast state-backed cheating scheme at the 2014 sochi games it hosted left it nominally barred as a team from the games.        the international olympic committee had been considering allowing russia to march under its own flag at the closing ceremony sunday. but several members now privately suggested that allowing that would risk appearing to appease russia and could undercut an effort to play up the peacemaking presence of a north korea delegation at the games.  krushelnytsky stands out because he does not ski, skate or soar off banks of halfpipes seven stories high — athletic pursuits here that are among the most physically demanding. no, he curls, sweeping a broom to guide a granite rock across a sheet of ice.            image     the russian curler alexander krushelnytsky, shown here practicing ahead of pyeongchang games matches, failed a doping test and may have to surrender his bronze medal in mixed doubles.   credit  aaron favila/associated press         on rare occasions, there have been doping violations in curling, since it is, on balance, a taxing feat of endurance to sweep the broom round after round. the sport, however, is not accustomed to being at the center of such a high-profile case, so the news sowed confusion and puzzlement among the curlers here.  “i was a bit shocked this morning,” said madeleine dupont, the skip of the danish women’s team. “i was like, ‘that cannot be true.’ but then again, people have been taking all sorts of stuff: natural medicine or lip balm or i don’t know what. so i wouldn’t really judge anyone until i knew it was on purpose.”        asked if she thought the sport’s reputation could be harmed, dupont said: “i think most people will laugh and be like, ‘what would you possibly need doping for?’”  krushelnytsky, in a routine urine check, was found to have traces of meldonium in his system. use of the drug, a heart medicine that increases blood flow and has been banned from most sports since 2016, has ensnared other russian athletes in doping cases in the past couple years.  neither krushelnytsky, who has left the athletes’ village for seoul, the south korean capital, to await the results of the final test, nor his wife, anastasia bryzgalova, are competing in the team events.  sergei belanov, the coach of the russian women’s team, voiced public support for krushelnytsky.  “i don’t believe that a young man, a clever man, will use the same doping that was so big the last two years,” belanov said. “it’s stupid. but alexander is not stupid. so sorry, i don’t believe it.”              the drug is thought to enhance endurance and would possibly play a role in curling by increasing the stamina of athletes, who must be accurate with their shots, sometimes down to the centimeter. hard sweeping can take a toll over the course of a long match. as a result, more curlers than ever, especially at the olympic level, are  training with weights and focusing on fitness  to improve their endurance and precision.  “it’s like any sport: you need strength,” nina roth said after leading the united states women’s team to a narrow win against denmark. “but you have to do it on your own merit.”        brent laing, who plays for the canadian men’s team, said he had no idea how meldonium would enhance performance.  “outside of beer and advil, that’s the only painkillers i’ve ever heard of for curling,” laing said. “i imagine it wasn’t that. hopefully not, or else i’d be in trouble.”  russia was barred from the olympics in december after an investigation into a state-backed doping program. the international olympic committee, however, later cleared more than 160 russian athletes to compete here in pyeongchang as olympic athletes from russia under the olympic banner.  moiseeva, whose team lost to switzerland on monday morning, said she thought about reaching out to krushelnytsky and bryzgalova but decided against it. she would not have known what to say to them, she said.  “it’s impossible to believe,” moiseeva said in russian, adding: “we delighted in the results and in the success of the pair. it’s impossible to believe that someone could do such a thing and sleep calmly at night and ruin not just the life of one person but those of a large number of people.”  she went on, “we always said it was so great to be involved in a sport where you wouldn’t have such scandals because this is simply not necessary. you don’t need to be faster, higher and stronger. you need to be more accurate, not necessarily stronger. i can’t even understand what medication would be necessary and what you could use it for in curling. for that reason, it’s very hard to believe.”        that this was playing out at the curling venue contrasted with a sport known for exacting standards when it comes to courteous behavior and a sense of fair play. curling also has a long tradition of opponents meeting for beers after a good, clean bonspiel (curling lingo for tournament).  but even before the doping case, curling had experienced its share of controversy here at the olympics.  last week, rachel homan, the skip of the canadian women’s team, broke with etiquette by having a curling stone removed from competition when an opponent from denmark accidentally touched it with her broom. after denmark came back to win, dupont, the team’s skip, told a reporter from cbc sports that it was “karma.” even some canadian fans were bothered by homan’s decision.  then, on sunday, an equipment malfunction appeared to cost the women’s team from britain in a loss to sweden. eve muirhead, the skip for britain, had her final throw of the match voided when a red light lit up on her rock, indicating that she had not released the handle in time. but video replays later showed that she had not committed a foul.  in any case, the biggest scandal was yet to come.

       " 'can it be close to 20 years since tara lipinski, then 15, upset michelle kwan at the 1998 winter games in nagano, japan, to become the youngest olympic figure skating champion?  sixteen years since sarah hughes won gold at the 2002 olympics in salt lake city, with kwan adding bronze? twelve years since sasha cohen took silver in 2006 in turin, italy?  no american woman since has won an olympic medal in the singles competition. and only one, ashley wagner, has won a medal at the annual world championships, taking silver in 2016. (she got bronze at the 2014 winter games in sochi, russia, in the newly added team event.)  that mostly fallow decade has created low expectations for any american woman to reach the medal podium at the 2018 winter games in february in pyeongchang, south korea.        the national championships, which begin wednesday in san jose, calif., will complete the selection of the olympic team. but as the sport has grown more technically demanding, female skaters from the united states have largely become sideline performers in a sport they once dominated.            image     evgenia medvedeva of russia, who will be considered the olympic favorite if she can recover from a foot injury. medvedeva completes some jumps with an arm over her head, which increases her degree of difficulty.   credit  joe klamar/agence france-presse — getty images         the reasons include what lipinski views as a failure by american officials to teach young skaters to maximize points in the current scoring system. among other things, the system awards a 10 percent bonus for jumps performed in the second half of routines, prizing technical mastery on tired legs.  wagner sees a cultural hesitancy in the united states, compared with russia, to train young girls to achieve great early success at the risk of injury and burnout in their teenage years.  the russian system values centralized training, in which many top skaters train together and push one another every day.        “in moscow, it’s more like a factory of production,” said rafael arutyunyan, who coaches wagner and worked for many years in russia.  japanese, south korean and russian women have won gold at the last three winter games. and many experts predict that russian teenagers will win two of the three available medals at the 2018 olympics.  that is, if the russians can show that they have passed rigorous drug screenings to gain entry because of a state-supported doping scandal at the 2014 winter games in russia that compelled the international olympic committee  to ban the country  as a team but allow cleared athletes to compete.            image        alina zagitova, 15, of russia places all of her jumps in the second half of her four-minute free skate, a strategy that yields bonus points for stamina.   credit  marco bertorello/agence france-presse — getty images         at 26, wagner, a three-time national champion, has reached what she calls a “make it or break it” moment for her olympic career after finishing seventh in the 2014 singles competition.  ideally, many fans of figure skating would like to see a mature skater like wagner win a medal, said lipinski, who is now a commentator for nbc. she described wagner as someone who has “had a lot of life experiences” and “is a beautiful artist and storyteller.”  but artistry jousts eternally with athleticism in skating. and with the old 6.0 system gone since 2004, there are fewer moments available for purely artistic interludes. now, champions must gobble up points like pac-man pellets, even if a score of say, 212, means little to many spectators except the boiling point of water.        the russians have expertly adapted to the current system, which awards a specific number of points for everything from jumps and spins to footwork and musical interpretation. the base value of a triple axel, for instance, is 8.5 points. some russian girls as young as 10 or 11 can perform the most difficult jumps, arutyunyan, the coach, said. and many jumps are loaded into the second half of routines, racking up bonus points for stamina.  evgenia medvedeva, 18, a two-time world champion and a heavy favorite to win olympic gold if she recovers from a foot injury, completes some jumps with one arm extended above her head to increase the degree of difficulty. and she balances her jumping with a growing emotional and artistic maturity.  her training partner, alina zagitova, 15, who in december won the grand prix final, an important competition leading into the olympics, places all of her jumps in the second half of her four-minute free skate.            image        ashley wagner of the united states performing in november. wagner is considered the best american hope for a medal in women’s singles figure skating at the winter olympics in february. but “realistically, technically, she’s behind what’s happening in russia,” said lipinski, who is now an nbc commentator.   credit  julie jacobson/associated press         while wagner is probably the best american hope for a medal at the olympics, lipinski said on a recent teleconference call, “realistically, technically, she’s behind what’s happening in russia.”  russian officials have long rewarded novice and junior skaters for attempting difficult elements like three-revolution jumps, done alone or in combination, even if they fail.  because young american skaters were only recently pushed to reach such high technical levels, lipinski said, their growth has “sort of been stagnant.”        u.s. figure skating, the national governing body, introduced a program in 2015 to enhance the jumping skills of novices. still, the americans are playing catch-up. at the recent junior grand prix final, five of the six participants in the women’s competition were from russia.  although young skaters are extremely flexible and jumping is easier before the body fills out, some russian teenagers have faced sobering trade-offs for their success.  adelina sotnikova, who won the 2014 olympics at age 17, is not currently competing, citing injury. yulia lipnitskaya, who won gold in the team event for russia as a 15-year-old in 2014, retired this year, saying she has battled anorexia. and medvedeva broke a bone in her right foot.          wagner said there was a “huge culture difference” between the united states and russia in the approach to developing young skaters. while americans have been known to push their children at an early age in many sports, wagner said some skaters’ parents might be reluctant to accept that “my kid is going to give up their life at 5, 6, 7 for something we don’t know if it’s going to pay off or not.”  asked if the shooting-star careers of some russians had been detrimental to the sport, wagner said on a teleconference call, “when you are skating that intensely from such a young age, of course these girls are going to get burned out.”        explaining how she had sustained her own interest in skating, wagner said, “i wasn’t overloaded with it.”  still, she acknowledged that the current system was tailor made “for a 16-, 17-year-old russian girl who is technically strong.”  going forward, lipinski said, it may be difficult to find a wonderfully artistic skater in her 20s who can also perform the technical requirements needed to be a champion.  “at the same time, this is a sport,” lipinski said. “it’s in the olympics for a reason. you want to keep pushing the bar technically.”       ',\n",
       " \"they arrived for the opening ceremony dressed in pale gray coats, waving to the crowd and taking selfies as if to prove to themselves that they were really there, after all, at the olympics.      in fact, 169 olympic athletes from russia, as they are officially known, arrived in south korea for the pyeongchang games. after the scandal over russia’s state-controlled doping scheme at the 2014 sochi games, it seemed as if there would be no athletes from that country at all.             image     team russia at the opening ceremony.        watching them over the past two weeks has been to witness strange things.    the letters oar replaced rus on outfits and uniforms as if some newly born nation were competing.            the olympic flag has been shown next to the athletes’ names on television and also raised at medal ceremonies, though the tally of medals has been subdued because many of those who had won competitions in sochi were absent because of doping accusations.    not until day 14, with the victory of alina zagitova in the women’s figure skating, did russia claim its first gold medal.            image        uniforms are stamped with oar.            image        liubov nikitina at aerials.        the russian supporters in the stands took it upon themselves to make up for the quasi anonymity of the athletes and to push back against the international olympic committee’s punishment. some have come from relatively nearby cities of the russian far east such as vladivostok, magadan and yuzhno-sakhalinsk.    others appear to be part of organized groups, arriving at the games with matching hats and shirts bearing the phrase, “russia in my heart,” a poke at the location of the flag missing on the athletes’ attire.         they have been particularly visible at the hockey games, where cheerleaders have whirled pom-poms and they have belted out russian folk songs.             image        getting spray painted at sports house.            image        fans at a russia hockey game.        another center of action for fans has been the country’s sports house (it was prohibited from calling it russia house), near the cluster of venues in coastal gangneung.    gigantic matryoshkas adorn the walls, russian pop karaoke pumps up the atmosphere and fans gather to watch games on a giant screen.             image        ilia burov received a bronze medal.            image        the olympic flag in place of the russian one.        the behavior of the athletes, however has been muted and they are visibly on edge.    this week a russian curler, alexander krushelnytsky, who had won bronze in the mixed doubles curling event, failed a doping test and left the games.  on saturday, the international olympic committee is expected to announce whether the russian delegation will be allowed to march at the closing ceremony with its national flag and its usual uniforms.             image        alina zagitova won the russians' first gold medal on friday.       \",\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — race across the snow on skis as fast as you can. now stop and shoot a target the size of an oreo about 54 yards away. if you miss, you’ll ski penalty laps before you are allowed to race to the next set of targets.  most of us will never try the biathlon, a uniquely stressful sport that demands both physical intensity and emotional calm. but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn from it. talking to an olympic biathlete about how she trains for competition can offer a life lesson in managing stress and dialing back intensity and aggression in an instant.  “the physical things are difficult — using all your muscles and pumping your heart as fast as you can,” says clare egan, a 30-year-old from cape elizabeth, me. who lives and trains in lake placid, n.y. “but the mental piece is the biggest challenge of biathlon.”  egan, who competes this week in the team relay event at the pyeongchang olympics in south korea, has had plenty of practice with stress at these games. she has missed seven of 30 targets over two races, though even the best biathletes have races where the aim just isn’t there. i spoke with egan as well as a sports psychologist, sean mccann, who works with biathletes on the united states team, about the mental challenges of biathlon and what the rest of us can learn from the sport. bottom line, it’s all about preparation, knowing that you are entering a stressful situation and figuring out ahead of time how you are going to deal with it.        here’s what they had to say.   be prepared.  egan starts managing the stress of the event well before she starts a race. she always skis the course in the days leading up to the race so there are no surprises. she identifies physical markers — a tree or a flagpole — that will help her recognize that she’s near the shooting range. it’s a small but important step in reducing the stress of competition. “that is going to be a reminder to me that i need to switch from ski mode to shooting mode,” she says.         video                    when the pressure starts to build, lowell bailey wonders: “can i do this?” then he looks at the snow ahead and imagines himself as a bow with an arrow drawn, ready to accelerate.   credit   credit  photo by margaret cheatham williams/the new york times; photo illustration by andrew khosravani and aaron byrd         exhale slowly.  studies have shown that  controlled breathing,  even when you’re not competing in the olympics, helps to both reduce stress and increase alertness. mccann works with egan and other biathletes on their breathing technique to help them calm themselves slightly in the few seconds they have to switch from racing mode to shooting mode. while their heart rate remains high, mindful breathing helps them slow it just enough to complete the target portion of the competition.  “if you’ve ever tried to slam the brakes on your breathing, it’s pretty hard to do,” says mccann. “one of the ways you can change the rhythm of your breathing is to slow the exhale. it takes some practice, but if you slow the exhale, the inhale will take care of itself. it’s one way to go from a rapid in-and-out to slower breathing.”         be mindful.  being fully aware of the challenges around you is an important step in managing any stressful situation. about 30 seconds before she gets to the shooting range, egan looks at the wind flags and thinks about how she might adjust. she begins to slow her breathing. she gets to the range and positions herself on the mat, eyeing her targets.            who won the most medals and more olympics questions, answered  the world’s best athletes schussed down the slopes, zoomed down the track and skated across the ice in south korea. here’s what you want to know about this year’s events.       “the next 15 seconds are the ones where i have to be extremely mindful,” she says. “i have this task i’ve done thousands of times that i’m trying to repeat. i know that i’m going to have distractions. the person next to me hit all of the targets. the fans are screaming. the person on the loudspeaker says, ‘here’s clare egan from the u.s.a. let’s see if she can hold it together.’”  mindfulness practices have taught her to accept the distractions.  “for shooting, you need to remove any kind of emotion from what you’re doing,” she says. “there’s my target, here’s my trigger, this is my process, now i’m going to make the shot.”   focus on the task, not the results.  one of the most vulnerable moments is when a biathlete has hit four targets and is about to take the last shot. “‘if i hit this, i’ll win the gold medal’ — as soon as you have that thought, you’re definitely going to miss it,” egan says. “that extra push or desire to win is not only not helpful, it’s counterproductive. you have to eliminate that from your mind and focus on the task.  just ask martin fourcade, the world’s top biathlete, who missed the shot that would have guaranteed him the gold medal in the final round of shooting in the 15-kilometer mass start race on sunday. being fourcade, he  won anyway in a photo finish , but hitting one more target would have made his triumph a whole lot easier.  egan says her strategy is to replace goal-oriented thoughts (“i have to hit this last shot”) with cue words that help her focus on the things that will get the job done. words like form, breathing, trigger and follow-through. “you have to eliminate all of that noise in your mind,” egan says. “i have to use some kind of process-oriented word about how to shoot well.”  “even if you’ve only done mini-golf, you can understand the concept of following through,” she says.         compete against yourself, nobody else.  “if you’ve ever been to a biathlon race, you get to the last shooting stage and so many people are missing — the pressure is on,” egan says. “even the best athletes in the world are subject to the last-stage meltdowns.”  the key to biathlon is focusing on your own process and tasks and not being distracted by the potential outcome or how others are performing. “i think that is a principle that applies to really everything,” egan says. “i think such a big part of this is focusing on what you are doing. you have to let go of how everyone else is doing, and focus on your own work.”  “if you can do that,” she adds, “you’re going to have a performance you can be proud of, whether it’s giving a presentation at work or a piano recital or biathlon.”       ',\n",
       " 'women box at the olympics. they pole-vault and snowboard and play rugby. but one sport in which women do not participate is the little-known winter event known as nordic combined.  the international olympic committee, which has for years made equality of participation by gender a goal, wants to change that. so a dictate to f.i.s., the global skiing federation, and national teams went out: get those women’s nordic combined programs going.  that was easier said than done. nordic combined requires athletes to both ski jump and cross-country ski. although some junior programs are out there, for the most part female nordic combined specialists just don’t exist.  “there aren’t that many participants right now,” said luke bodensteiner, chief of sport for u.s. ski and snowboard, the national governing body. “it hasn’t really developed all that naturally. the i.o.c. said: ‘we need gender balance across all our sports. otherwise the future prospects of nordic combined are bleak.’”        so the united states arranged its first national championship for women’s nordic combined in october. two athletes showed up.  “development has probably gone less quickly than f.i.s. would like to see it,” bodensteiner said.  men’s nordic combined dates to the first winter games in 1924, but the women’s sport is in its infancy. it is not part of the pyeongchang games. but in all likelihood, ready or not, it will be on the olympic menu in 2022 in beijing. its sudden emergence is giving athletes and federations something of a free shot at olympic medals.            image     lussi in the cross-country portion of the nordic combined national championship in lake placid, n.y., in october. because there was not enough snow in lake placid, lussi and her competitor, gabby armstrong, used roller skis for cross-country.   credit  ben pieper/point productions         the winner of the two-woman competition, and the first united states national champion, was nina lussi, 23, a ski jumper.  “i have a bit of a background in nordic combined,” said lussi, a native of lake placid, n.y., where the competition was held. “we had nordic combined races at the junior level up to the age of about 16. although the cross-country aspect is not my favorite part.”        at the nationals, lussi easily defeated her opponent, gabby armstrong, in the ski jumping portion. as a result, she started the cross-country race with a lead of four and a half minutes. though she skied almost three minutes slower than armstrong, lussi held on for the win.  because the event came before significant snowfall in lake placid, the cross-country race was held using roller skis. “i took some lessons, ‘learn to roller ski for dummies,’” lussi said. “i was having trouble breathing on a very steep uphill. definitely my lungs were thanking me when i was finished.”  as for the small field, “i was disappointed,” she said. “i thought it was a good opportunity for the juniors. to not have the entries was disappointing.”  so far, ski jumpers are the target athletes for the event, more so than cross-country skiers. “jumping’s pretty hard to learn,” bodensteiner said. “i don’t foresee much transfer from cross-country skiing.” he noted that the scoring generally favors jumpers, and that male nordic combined athletes tend to be “prototypical ski jumpers.”  the tentative plan is to scale up women’s nordic combined rapidly. the first continental cup event, the level below world cup, was held in january in norway, with 14 entrants (armstrong placed 12th). a world cup will follow in 2020, with a world championship in 2021 and the olympics in 2022. time is short.  “it really has to be done, and it’s the right thing to do,” said silke tegethof, the media coordinator for nordic combined with f.i.s.              ”countries like germany, austria and norway, they started working on their development program up to four years ago,” lussi said. “we need to get a kick in that direction. we have great hope in tara.”        tara geraghty-moats, 24, is exactly the kind of athlete who could excel in the sport for the united states. she is a top-level ski jumper who has also competed in cross-country skiing and biathlon. she would have been a third participant in the national championships but missed them because of a broken arm.  geraghty-moats said of the dawn of women’s nordic combined: “it’s so exciting. i’ve been waiting about 13 years. when i was 10 or 11, people said wouldn’t it be cool because you’re so good” at nordic combined. “had there been women’s nordic combined when i was younger, i would have been a nordic combined athlete.”  she said that many ski jumpers could have the ability to succeed at nordic combined because of their training background. “ski jumpers, for sure, they try to get you on cross-country skis,” she said. “it helps with balance and coordination.”  one complication of nordic combined is that the ideal body types for the two elements of the discipline tend to be different. “ski jumping, you want to be light; cross-country, you want to be fast,” geraghty-moats said. ideal nordic combined athletes, she said, would be “cross-country skiers with leaner builds.”  women’s nordic combined is taking an unconventional path to the olympics. it is not a sport that has bubbled up from the grass roots to force its way into the games. instead a top-down edict about gender equality has caused national federations to scramble to start programs.  women are almost certain to have nordic combined as a medal sport at the olympics in four years. the opportunity is there; it’s just a matter of who takes it.  bodensteiner said he believed that the lure of the games would be enough. “once they start awarding olympic medals,” he predicted. “people will start chasing them.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the international olympic committee has upheld its suspension of russia as a team from the games, a move that will force the country’s athletes to march in the closing ceremony without their national colors or flag.  the decision, in a unanimous vote here sunday, came after two failed drug tests by russian athletes — among nearly 170 competing here under a special dispensation — and after a long night of talks among senior i.o.c. officials.  russia’s olympic committee was banned in december after revelations of one of the most sophisticated doping programs in sports history, including an elaborate scheme at the 2014 sochi games in russia. the i.o.c. will consider reinstating the russian committee if all remaining drug tests for its athletes at the pyeongchang games come back clean.  nicole hoevertsz, the leader of the i.o.c.’s panel reviewing russia’s compliance, said russia could be reinstated within the next week.        the i.o.c. decision came after protracted discussion over two days.  “we should draw a line, we have to draw a line and look to the future,” hoevertsz said.  russia’s final doping test results are anticipated within 72 hours, and if they are clean, the country will be restored to the i.o.c. in early march, hoevertsz said.  with the vote, the i.o.c.’s membership rubber-stamped a recommendation from its executive board. that group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on saturday.  the bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late saturday. the report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the russian olympic committee.  two investigations revealed that russia’s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years. many of russia’s top athletes were linked to the scandal and barred from the games.         alina zagitova , a 15-year-old figure skater, was the only russian to have won a gold medal in pyeongchang by the time the committee voted. the men’s hockey team won a second gold on sunday, defeating germany.  the russians will now leave the olympics the way they entered: in neutral uniforms that provided a constant reminder of the damage done to russia’s sporting reputation by the scheme, a state-controlled effort to replace drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones, according to the investigations.  president vladimir v. putin of russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.  the effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. before the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro, where russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. it made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these winter olympics. both attempts were unsuccessful.  a russian delegation that included evgenia medvedeva, the silver medalist in women’s figure skating, made a presentation to the executive board.  the bobsledder nadezhda sergeeva’s  positive drug test  the day before did not help russia’s cause. she was the second russian to fail a drug test here. when the i.o.c. banned russia on dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country’s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.  “this is not a decision everyone will be happy with,” hoevertsz said after sunday’s vote. “we will be criticized.”        the decision to potentially reinstate russia met skepticism on sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 summer olympics. in those tests, russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both games, according to the i.o.c.’s own statistics (18 out of 65 from beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from london 2012)  “if the retests shows the result then the i.o.c will take the appropriate measures,” bach said at a news conference sunday afternoon, without elaborating.  richard pound, the i.o.c.’s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of russia. adam pengilly, a british member who also has been critical of the i.o.c.’s reaction to the russia scandal, was sent home from the games after an altercation with a security guard.  after being warned that their conduct would affect the i.o.c.’s decision, russian athletes have largely been keeping a low profile in south korea. they have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols.  the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said. russia’s i.o.c. member, shamil tarpischev, said “a lack of cultural education” was to blame.  russia will be welcomed back as a full-fledged olympic nation if all of its remaining drugs tests from the pyeongchang games are negative. then the i.o.c. can try to move on from one of the biggest scandals in olympics history.  athletes from around the world have been among the most critical voices opposing russia’s return. on saturday, american biathletes joined others to say they wouldn’t participate in a season-ending event in russia.  “we believe this should be the end of this big problem and pave the way for a new chapter in olympic sport,” tarpischev said.       ',\n",
       " 'in the wake of tuesday’s international olympic committee decision  to ban the russian  team from the winter games in south korea in february, many assumed companies that have invested in the games would take a serious financial hit.  but the removal of the united states’ biggest rival just nine weeks ahead of the pyeongchang olympics might actually help the games commercially, especially in the united states.  a yet-to-be-determined number of russian athletes will be allowed to compete as neutral individuals, if they can convince antidoping experts that they are clean. many russians are likely to be absent, though, and that will make americans more competitive and more likely to win medals. over the years, that has been the essential ingredient for a highly watched and financially successful olympics on this side of the pond, according to olympics insiders and experts with decades of experience in the art of selling the games.  “there is no doubt that our audience likes to see americans performing well,” said mark lazarus, the chairman of nbc broadcasting and nbc sports, which will televise the olympics in the united states.        rob prazmark, who has negotiated corporate sponsorship deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars for the olympics during the past three decades, put it even more bluntly. “for the american viewing audience, it is about americans winning,” he said.  the last time olympic competition was compromised so substantially was 1984, when the soviet union and most eastern bloc countries boycotted the los angeles olympics. the soviets claimed sending their athletes to the united states posed a security risk, though the move was most likely a retaliation for the united states boycott four years earlier, when the games were in moscow.  abc, which broadcast those games in america, considered asking the international olympic committee for a rebate on its broadcast rights payment after the countries announced their boycott. that idea was dropped after the games were a  massive ratings success . the united states won a record 83 gold medals.  for months, it appeared the pyeongchang games were poised to return to the box office hit, cold war, united states vs. russia narrative. that story line has been removed from the equation, thanks to brazen attempts to rig the sochi olympics by corrupting the drug-testing lab.  after accepting the findings of an independent investigation that russia’s sports hierarchy had cheated, the olympic committee ruled that a russian team would not march in the opening ceremony, the russian flag would not fly and the anthem would not play. russian athletes who can participate will wear a uniform that says, “olympic athlete from russia,” or oar — but the russian olympic delegation is banned and the country cannot officially win any medals.        the ruling actually delivered much-needed buzz and attention to an event that research and slow ticket sales suggest has been severely lacking in both areas. lazarus, the nbc sports chief, said the scandal took the story “off the sports page and onto the front pages,” which could bring more viewers to the games.  “you’re going to see oar on the uniform, and they’re going to have to keep explaining that, keep telling that story,” said scott blackmun, chief executive of the united states olympic committee.  in recent weeks, the  olympic committee has stripped russian athletes of 11 medals  won in 2014, dropping the country to fourth in the medal table.  additional medals for the united states this time, and the subsequent ratings bump for nbc telecasts, are likely to please the corporate sponsors of team usa. and the official russian absence should not harm the olympic committee’s biggest sponsors — companies like coca-cola, visa, samsung and toyota — experts said.  most olympic committee sponsors have long-term contracts, and they will applaud tuesday’s decision because it might restore public confidence in the organization and show it is committed to preventing cheating athletes from competing.  larry probst, chairman of the united states olympic committee and a member of the i.o.c., said he had discussed possible penalties with thomas bach, the i.o.c. president, in october. the i.o.c., probst said, included many of his suggestions in its ruling this week. he noted that this year’s track and field world championships had been held successfully in london without a russian team, which track and field’s world governing body had banned for a related doping scandal.  “we are very pleased with what they did,” probst said of the international olympic committee.  in recent years, many olympic competitions have become more competitive and evolved from a sports competition for superpowers to one with a more worldwide flavor, reducing the impact of any one country’s participation.        “i think people are watching because it’s the olympics, and they want to see individual athletes excel and push the edge of human achievement,” jim scherr, the former chief executive of the united states committee, said.  it seems there is only one country whose absence from the olympics would be ruinous for the i.o.c.: the united states. nbc paid $963 million to broadcast these games, far more than any other broadcaster. more than half of the olympic committee’s global sponsors are american companies.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — behold the riddle of how many russian athletes will compete at the winter olympics.  the international olympic committee announced in december that russia  was barred  because of a doping scheme that had corrupted the results of several games. so zero russians would compete in pyeongchang, right? not exactly.  the i.o.c. propped open a side door for russian athletes. about 400 of them  were told that they could compete  — under a neutral flag, wearing neutral uniforms — if they proved that they hadn’t violated antidoping protocols.  russia later named about 170 of those athletes to its olympic team, even though, technically, russia is not allowed to have an olympic team, because — remember — russia is  banned  from these olympics.        on wednesday, the court of arbitration for sport said it was hurrying to consider the appeals of 47 russian athletes and coaches who still believed they should be allowed to participate — including two gold medal winners from the 2014 sochi games.  so how many olympic athletes from russia, as the contingent is to be called, will march in the opening ceremony on friday?            image     athletes are arriving and training in pyeongchang, but only days before the games open, no one knows how many russian athletes will take part.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         the answer: too many.  the court of arbitration for sport now says it might finish deciding the last-ditch russian appeals late thursday night or early friday morning.  “i think that the timing of all this is ridiculous,” said lowell bailey, an american biathlete and a reigning world champion, who added that the i.o.c. should acknowledge that it is partly responsible for this unnecessary chaos.        “i think it did fail clean athletes,” bailey said.  the i.o.c. had the better part of two years to figure out this puzzle and to decide which russians — if any — should compete in pyeongchang. if clean sport were really a priority for the i.o.c., as it so often claims, the organization could have prioritized investigating the accusations that the russians tampered with the drug testing in sochi. it could have barred athletes and coaches early, and then slogged through the appeals.  but it didn’t. instead, the i.o.c. took its time. and now, there’s no time left.  the chance was there to deliver a stern warning to any country that might consider systematic doping: drug your athletes, or mess with the testing, and your flag will disappear from the olympics.  yes, a blanket ban might have hurt some clean russian athletes, but it would also have been a motivation for future whistle-blowers to come forward. if clean athletes thought they might be barred from the games for their compatriots’ transgressions, they would be more willing to speak out.  instead, the pyeongchang olympics are left with this: half-measures like missing flags and unplayed anthems, and the full-throated boldness of russia pushing the i.o.c. to make concessions.  at a news conference on wednesday, the i.o.c. president, thomas bach, did not directly answer questions about the russians’ recent appeals, or what would happen if they were successful. but he did drop hints of the policy that olympic officials have held for years: the olympics are their party, and they will invite the people they want. in this case, competitors from an unwelcome country make up a special category of guests.            image        dozens of russian athletes, stripped of their national affiliation, are pressing appeals that might allow them to compete in the olympics.   credit  jae c. hong/associated press         “we think we have good arguments, and now that procedure is ongoing,” bach said of the appeals.  he gave excuses for how long it had taken to figure out the russian question. he said the i.o.c. needed every second it took to examine the cases properly. he said that was why dozens of these decisions had come down to the last moment.        nearly 10 russian biathletes are among the athletes who have filed appeals. that means there is quite a bit at stake for bailey, who is one of the united states olympic team’s most outspoken critics of doping.  bailey said he would be disappointed if the russians won their appeals. but he also said the i.o.c. had pledged, on a conference call with the panel that decided which russians to invite to these games, that there would be no retroactive invitations. now he can only hope that was true.  “if that changes,” he said, “that’s them going back on their word to me.”  this is the problem with i.o.c. math these days: when the committee said zero retroactive invitations, did it actually mean zero — or did it mean six, or 36, or even more? using the i.o.c. calculator, it’s hard to tell.  but the russians here — or, shall we say, the people from russia here — are feeling confident.  at an olympics where there weren’t supposed to be any russians, there is now a giant poster on the wall inside the main office for the team known as the olympic athletes from russia, or o.a.r.  in one corner of the poster is the pyeongchang olympics logo. in the other corner, an o.a.r. logo.  in the center, there’s a large, empty space. that is where the team expects to keep a tally of its medal haul.  that number, depressingly, almost certainly will not be zero.

       " 'when ticket sales were lagging in 2006 before the winter games in turin, italy, italian officials explained that the matter was not so much apathy for the olympics as it was a cultural mind-set.  “it’s typical for italians to do things at the last minute,” giuseppe gattino, a spokesman for the turin organizing committee, said at the time.  a few months before last summer’s rio olympics, when more than half of the 7.5 million tickets remained unsold, again the host country’s people were blamed for being last-minute shoppers. “brazilians, they do not buy tickets at such an early stage, as the british or the germans,” thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee, said.  now, with 100 days to go before the next olympics — the pyeongchang games, in south korea — bleak ticket sales and the prospect of empty arenas have revived the excuse that has become almost as familiar as the lighting of the caldron.        “koreans are known to be last-minute buyers,” said nancy park, a spokeswoman for the group that is responsible for organizing the pyeongchang games, in response to questions about why only 341,327 of 1.07 million tickets had been sold so far.  of course, the olympics are a tv spectacle above all else, so if the ratings are high most officials will be satisfied. the broadcasters who pay dearly for the rights to show the games can deftly minimize the glare of empty seats. still, if a host spends billions of dollars to stage the three-week sporting extravaganza and few people show up it is a bad look.            image     organizers of the 2016 summer games in rio de janeiro also had trouble generating excitement for some events.   credit  matthias hangst/getty images         “this is not the first time you get these concerns,” said michael payne, the former head of marketing for the international olympic committee, who noted that the games tended to turn out just fine. “but i’m sure the i.o.c. is telling the pyeongchang organizing committee, ‘come on, guys, you better raise your game here with more active promotion.’ ”  though many host cities have struggled to sell tickets, pyeongchang’s situation is particularly grim. as of oct. 24, 57 percent of 320,000 tickets for the pyeongchang games reserved for international fans had been sold — but nearly 80 percent of the 750,000 tickets allocated to south koreans were still available.        the numbers for the paralympics, which will take place in pyeongchang from march 9 to 18, were even worse. according to the organizing committee, only 8,902 tickets had been sold as of oct. 24, with the vast majority purchased as part of group packages. only 499 individual tickets had been sold.  the sales figures were met with gasps, and revived long-simmering questions about whether the organizing committee had been doing enough to promote the games; whether recent political turmoil inside the country and the escalation of tensions with north korea might be suppressing excitement about the event; and whether south koreans even cared enough about winter sports to travel to an unassuming ski town 80 miles east of seoul.  “filling the stadiums is the goal and challenge of every organizing committee,” said park, the spokeswoman. “we are focused on building up the excitement and continuing to encourage the public to buy their tickets for the olympic and the paralympic winter games.”  the committee noted that many promotional activities were only now beginning.  on tuesday in athens, for example, the pyeongchang organizers received the olympic flame in a ceremony that initiated a 100-day countdown to the start of the games in february. after leaving greece, the torch was scheduled to travel 2018 kilometers across south korea, visiting 17 cities and provinces, before the opening ceremony.  “once the flame lands in south korea, i hope the olympic fever will surge with the torch relay,” said kim yu-na, the former figure skater who was a member of the south korean delegation on tuesday in athens, according to yonhap news agency.  organizers will hope that fever translates into ticket sales. on wednesday, the offline sale period will begin in south korea, making tickets, which until now were limited to the event website, available at designated offices around the country.  the pyeongchang games will be held a few hours from seoul, the country’s largest city. snow sports, like skiing and biathlon, will be held in the mountains in pyeongchang. indoor ice sports, like figure skating and hockey, will be in gangneung.        news reports from south korea indicated that regional government offices have been allocating more funds to buy blocks of tickets, with plans to distribute them to schools, disadvantaged families and other groups.  “we always tend to be late buyers for all events,” said park, pointing to the 2002 world cup soccer tournament and the 2014 asian games in incheon as examples.  park also tried to dispel the idea, pushed recently in some news media reports, that the specter of conflict with north korea and the perception of political disquiet on the peninsula had held down ticket sales.  she said comments of support from the international olympic committee and major national committees had hopefully put international fans at ease after reports that certain countries had expressed safety concerns.  and specifically within south korea, she suggested, people have been largely inured to the threatening rhetoric from their northern neighbors. “for koreans, the tensions are nothing new,” she said.  if the pyeongchang organizers cannot fully overcome their ticket sales challenge over the next couple of months, united states officials might have a solution. the united states army has a military base in seoul.  “that’s 20,000 or 30,000 people,” scott blackmun, chief executive of the united states olympic committee, said in an interview at the new york times on wednesday. “we’d love to try to get some of them into the seats.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — nathan chen reeled off four quadruple jumps in a practice before dawn friday, so he couldn’t blame the unusually early start time for the men’s figure skating team event for what happened next.  chen, an american teenager expected to contend later for the men’s singles crown, got off to a rough start in his olympic debut in the short program of the team event.  skating to benjamin clementine’s “nemesis,” chen, 18, struggled with the jumps that usually lift him above the competition. his opening quadruple flip was shaky, he turned his second quad into a double and he fell on a triple axel on his way to a score of 80.61, leaving the team initially in fourth place.            the quad jump is changing figure skating. nathan chen is leading the way.  if the u.s. figure skater wants gold in his first olympics, his quads will be crucial.       “obviously not what i wanted to do on my first olympic run,” chen said, adding, “all i can do is try to analyze what i did wrong and just let it go and move on.”        after the pairs short program, the american team moved up to second place behind canada and ahead of japan and a team made up of russian athletes allowed to compete despite their country being nominally banned over a state-backed doping scheme.  the team competition continues sunday with the ice dance short program, the women’s short program and the pairs free skate.  chen, whose  jumping ability and olympic medal prospects  figured in nbc’s push to hold figure skating in the mornings local time so it could be viewed in prime time in the united states, said he was “a little too excited” and “got ahead of himself.”  canada’s chan, a three-time olympian who will try to improve upon his silver-medal showing in the 2014 games in sochi in the men’s individual event, expressed sympathy for chen, saying it was normal to not have a great skate.        “it’s part of the experience, part of the olympics,” he said.  chan and chen, who both skated in the second group of five, occupy opposite ends of the competitive spectrum. chan, 27, won the first of three consecutive world championships in 2011 when chen was 11 years old and one year removed from a championship in the novice men’s event at the u.s. figure skating championships.  chen’s first olympics will be the last for chan, who told canadian reporters earlier in the week that his goal was to exit the ice feeling “really proud” of his performance. he said he had never skated a clean program in the olympics and would like to rectify that before he retires. chan did not achieve his goal on friday, falling on a quadruple toe and triple axel.  chan said the early start threw him off a little. “you have to take that into account,” he said.  but chen, the reigning two-time u.s. men’s champion, gave himself no such out. he said he was prepared to skate well and was disappointed that he let his teammates down. “i need to just recalculate everything in my head and do a better job,” he said.

       " 'gangneung, south korea — these were going to be the redemption games for elise christie,  who crashed or was disqualified  from all three of her individual races in short-track speedskating at the 2014 olympics in sochi.  in the four years since, britain’s christie had collected more than a dozen medals, she said, while competing against the best in her sport. at last year’s world championships, against essentially the same fields she would face here, christie recorded two victories.  she was considered the brightest medal hope for a britain team that, entering tuesday night, had already matched its highest medal total at a winter games with four. with a podium finish in her favorite event, the 1,000 meters, christie could seal britain’s best-ever showing.            image     elise christie failed to medal in any of her races at the 2014 sochi olympics. but the pyeongchang games offered a second chance.   credit  clive mason/getty images         but first she had to make it through tuesday’s qualifying heats, which was no given. christie’s redemption games had unfolded like a rerun of 2014. in her first event, the 500 meters, she crashed in the final and finished fourth. in the semifinals of the 1,500, she was carried off the ice in a stretcher after a collision that caused her right ankle to swell like bread dough.        as christie received treatment for ligament damage, a debate raged in her head. “parts of me were saying, ‘it’s not meant to be, don’t bother going on,’” she said. “and part of me was saying, ‘just fight once more, give it one more try.’”  another debate  raged on social media,  where people wondered: was christie a star-crossed olympian? or did the olympics bring out the worst in her?  for every person on twitter who suggested christie cracked under pressure, there were several others who came to her defense. in the days leading up to the 1,000, christie retweeted several messages of support, including  one  from a woman who pointedly asked christie’s detractors, “when did any of you get to represent your country at anything?”              image        christie left the ice on a stretcher on saturday after injuring her ankle in the 1,500 meters, but returned for a final try at a medal in the 1,000 on tuesday.   credit  european pressphoto agency         christie, 27, who  received death threats  after taking out south korea’s leading contender in a collision in sochi, russia, described the support as “incredible” and said, “to me it means more than the medal that people can see how hard i’ve tried.”  all eyes were on christie when she skated to the starting line for the fifth of eight heats. before the first curve, she got tangled with another skater, fell and skidded into the safety pads. under short-track rules, a crash on the first lap results in a restart. but first christie had to get back on her feet. she tried a couple times to rise, without success. she thought she was done. “i can’t describe the amount of pain i was in,” christie said.  but then she said she imagined all the people watching back home. “and i just thought, i’m going to give it my best shot,” she said, adding, “i thought of the adrenaline and how that might take over.”  she rose unsteadily, favoring her right foot, and gingerly skated over to consult with her coach before returning to the starting line for the nine-lap race. christie was last after the first lap, last after the second, last after the third. then, as the spectators at gangneung ice arena threw their voices behind her, she made her move. “the support from korea, the support from the u.k., has been insane,” said christie, who was second with a lap to go. in the final meters, there was some jostling for position, but christie held her ground and finished behind lara van ruijven of the netherlands.  “i just thought it was a normal race and i moved up and i qualified and i was so happy,” christie said.        but it was not to be. she received a yellow card for two separate minor infringements. christie said she had no idea what she had done. all she knew was that for the second consecutive olympics, she would leave with nothing tangible to show for four years of monomaniacal devotion to her sport.  christie stepped off the ice and was scooped up by the national short-track coach, nicky gooch. in 1994, gooch won britain’s first medal in short-track speedskating. christie had come here hoping to become her country’s first gold medalist and second medal-winner in the sport.  as reporters waited to talk with her, they were joined by scott field, the head of communications for the british olympic association, who said softly: “go easy on her. do me a favor.”            image        christie rallied from the back of the pack to finish second in her 1,000-meter heat but was later disqualified for a rules violation.   credit  james hill for the new york times         christie cried after her first two failures to medal here, but on tuesday night her eyes stayed mostly dry. she had trouble getting through her first television interview, but not because she was upset. “i’m not crying, i’m just coughing,” she said.  she dismissed any talk of an olympic jinx, saying: “it’s not because it’s an olympics. it’s just because it’s short-track. that’s the way it goes sometimes.”  christie was devastated for a long time after the sochi olympics, but she said she expected the healing process to be quicker this time. the difference, she explained, was that in 2014 she wondered if maybe she wasn’t cut out to be an olympic medalist — “it wasn’t in me,” is how she put it — and that is why she had faltered.  “i don’t see that now,” christie added. “i just see it was three races that went rubbish in the last four years.”       ',\n",

coin flip was used as a tiebreaker, and hamlin won.        “no problem,” davis added in the tweet. “i can wait until 2022.”  davis, competing at his fifth and presumably final games, added the

perturbed-looking ushers came down and broke up the crowd, forcing the pair to leave the stands.  the trump look-alike seemed a bit flustered as he worked his way up the steps. the kim look-alike could be heard telling him in english, “walk slowly.”  they ducked into a concourse, a pack of journalists in their wake.  the parade of nations followed the korean alphabet.  the backbone of any opening ceremony is the parade of nations. while there are always a diversity of outfits and glimpses of athletic stars, its sheer length can test even the most geographically fascinated fan. this

(he would not offer any spoiler alerts.)        looking relaxed in a black turtleneck sweater and jeans, mr. song said that his biggest concern in the run-up to the ceremony was the cold. “we had to develop many contingency plans just in case the weather went bad,” he said. a few days ago, when temperatures plunged below zero degrees fahrenheit, dancers were given spikes for their shoes to ensure that they could dance in icy conditions. mr. song said that engineers were also concerned that the hundreds of electronic devices being deployed for the ceremony might not work in the freezing temperatures, but “we tested them at the rehearsal, and they were fine.”  as it turns out, the weather on friday night was practically balmy, expected to fall only to about 28 degrees.  mr. song said he struggled to keep the show, which features 1,300 performers and another 700 volunteers in one scene, within a “very limited budget.” he declined to say what that budget was, but noted with a laugh: “it was far less than beijing.”  thomas bach, gold medalist, opened the games.  thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee, made his appearance. as always, he was introduced as a “gold medal winner” (he won a fencing medal in 1976).  kim yo-jong, the sister of the north korean leader, kim jong-un, was also in attendance, together with the north’s ceremonial head of state, kim yong-nam. president moon jae-in of south korea shook hands with ms. kim briefly.            image        kim yo-jong, sister of kim jong-un, at the opening ceremony.   credit  doug mills/the new york times             image        members of the north korean cheering squad sang and waved the unified flag.   credit  james hill for the new york times             image        performers blanketed pyeongchang olympic stadium, which will be demolished after the games.   credit  james hill for the new york times         a modest venue, curiously shaped — and temporary.  there are several unusual things about the site for the ceremony, pyeongchang olympic stadium. first off, it’s small. seating 35,000, it is dwarfed by the likes of the maracanã (78,000), which played host to the summer games in 2016. second, it’s just for the ceremony, not any athletic events. third, it’s temporary. it will be demolished after the games. and lastly, it is an unusual shape, a pentagon. evocative of the olympic rings, other “five” symbolism was featured in the show.  it’s cold, but everybody’s prepared.  the forecasts were true: it’s pretty cold here.  temperatures dipped to around 28 degrees as fans started to enter the stadium an hour before the ceremony, and steady winds made it feel far chillier than that.  reports emerged during the week that scores of spectators attending a rehearsal last saturday ended up leaving early because of the extreme cold. but several fans outside the stadium on friday declared themselves ready to face the chill.  “i’m from buffalo,” said mary salvador, who had traveled from new york to join a group of korean adoptees from around the united states. moments earlier, she had pulled on a pair of dark ski pants. pulling hand warmers from her pocket, she added, “you need these. we’ve been using these all week.”  the ceremonies at the previous two winter olympics, in sochi, russia, and vancouver, british columbia, were indoors, and cold temperatures were not an issue at those games, anyway.  organizers here were proactive in addressing the weather. each attendee at the stadium received a package that included hand and foot warmers, a wool hat, a poncho, a blanket and a heated seat cushion.  “just wear layers and layers to protect yourself from the wind,” said lauri leppanen, 38, who was visiting from turku, finland, with his partner, sanna saarinen, 35. “i’m wearing merino wool, which is pretty cozy.”       ',\n",

       " 'there is significant evidence that russia was involved in a sweeping state-sponsored doping program at the 2014 winter games in sochi, russia. as a result, the country and many of its athletes have been hit with penalties.  but at least 150 russian athletes will be competing at the winter olympics. so what are they doing there? it has been a tale of charges, countercharges, appeals and counterappeals. and it’s not over yet.  confused? you are not alone. we can help.   why is russia at the olympics?  the international olympic committee in december  barred russia from the games , citing systematic doping. russian government officials are forbidden to attend, the russian flag will not be displayed at the opening ceremony and the anthem will not sound.  but as in 2016, the olympic committee said that russian athletes with a history of rigorous drug testing could petition for permission to compete.         how many athletes qualified?  surprising many people, a robust team of 168 russians was cleared to participate in the games. while that is down from the 232 at the home sochi games, it is not far from the 177 that participated in vancouver, british columbia, in 2010.  last week, the court of arbitration for sport, the top international appeals court in these cases, overturned the bans of 28 more russian athletes implicated in the doping scandal. it said there was not enough evidence that the athletes had doped. eleven other bans were upheld but softened. the i.o.c. however said those athletes would not be invited to the games.  the court of arbitration for sport on friday ruled against 47 russian athletes and coaches who were challenging the international olympic committee’s decision that they could not participate in the 2018 winter games.   so are they going?    maybe. the olympic committee said the reinstated athletes were not necessarily eligible for the pyeongchang games. russia’s deputy prime minister, vitaly mutko, a former russian sports minister now serving a life suspension from the olympics, said russia would fight to allow the athletes to compete in pyeongchang.   so are these athletes representing russia or not?  it’s a little complicated and a bit silly. officially the athletes will not be the “russia” team, but will instead be designated as “olympic athletes from russia.” in a sense, that’s a semantic and symbolic distinction. russians who win gold will not hear their anthem played. but everyone will know they are russian, and few will be confused by the unusual flags and uniforms.         those uniforms must be a bit funky?  yes, and highly regimented. the olympic committee laid down strict rules about them. “print size for words ‘olympic athlete from’ should be equivalent to the word ‘russia,’ ” the committee ruled, perhaps trying to thwart typographical shenanigans like printing a tiny “olympic athlete from” dwarfed by a giant “russia.” the font was ordered to be “as generic as possible.”   are russia’s biggest stars eligible?  some are. an olympic figure skating favorite, evgenia medvedeva, 18, will be there. vic wild, an american-born russian gold medalist in parallel snowboard, is also on the list. alexander zubkov, driver of the winning two- and four-man bobsleds at sochi, was one of the 11 athletes who lost their arbitration appeals. viktor ahn, a triple gold medalist in short-track speedskating who was born in south korea, is also ineligible as of now.   what about the paralympics?  russia has also been barred from the paralympics, although organizers say perhaps 30 athletes will compete under a neutral flag. the entire russian team had been suspended from the 2016 summer paralympics.   tell me about russia’s doping program.  evidence and investigative panels have shown russia meticulously planned a doping program to ensure a good performance at the sochi winter games in 2014.  a three-drug cocktail of banned substances was mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of russian athletes. then, during the games, members of the intelligence service replaced urine samples tainted by drugs with clean urine, breaking into supposedly tamper-proof bottles that clearly were not. at night, they passed bottles through a hole in the wall.  beyond sochi, the world anti-doping agency has said that for years russian officials orchestrated a doping program that involved 1,000 athletes in 30 sports.         who was the whistle-blower?  grigory rodchenkov, who ran the laboratory that handled testing for 10 years. he is now living in the united states under protection from american authorities.   what has his reaction been?  through his lawyer, rodchenkov has criticized sports officials for not punishing russia forcefully enough for the cheating he helped expose. rodchenkov had  advocated  against a blanket ban, arguing for the inclusion of clean athletes but objecting to the wide loophole sports officials wound up offering the nation.  rodchenkov’s lawyer, jim walden, called this week’s exoneration of more than two dozen olympians who had been accused of cheating in sochi proof that “self-policing in international sports is a monumental failure.”       ',\n",
       " 'irena szewinska , a sprinter and long jumper who won seven medals in five olympic games, tying an olympic women’s record and becoming a national hero in poland, died on friday at a hospital in warsaw. she was 72.  the cause was cancer, said henryk urbas, the press spokesman for the polish olympic committee.  szewinska’s athletic accomplishments and long run of olympic appearances led many to consider her one of the greatest polish athletes of the 20th century. in a  tribute on twitter , president andrzej duda of poland called her “the first lady of polish sport,” and prime minister  mateusz morawiecki  called her “an inspiration for generations of polish athletes.”  a versatile, indefatigable athlete, szewinska set multiple world records; at one point she had the fastest times in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints. she stood a reedy 5 feet 9 inches tall and had a devastating kick, or last burst of speed, that sometimes let her snatch victory by a stride.  szewinska (pronounced sha-veen-ska) competed in her first olympic games in tokyo in 1964, when she was 18. she won silver medals in the 200-meter race and the long jump and a gold in the 400-meter relay.        in later olympics she won two more gold medals, in the 200-meter race at the mexico city games in 1968 and the 400-meter in montreal in 1976; and two bronzes, in the 100-meter in 1968 and the 200-meter at the munich games in 1972.  the only woman to win seven olympic medals for track and field events before szewinska was the australian runner and hurdler  shirley strickland , who won her medals in three games beginning in 1948.  the 400-meter finals in montreal in 1976 was one of szewinska’s most dramatic races. in the months before, she and the east german sprinter christina brehmer had both broken the world record for the 400-meter race, and now they were meeting in montreal.  szewinska pulled ahead in the last seconds of the race to beat brehmer by several meters for the gold medal. she had also set a new world record, 49.28 seconds — one that held until 1978, when the east german runner marita koch broke it.              image     szewinska at the international association of athletics federations indoor world championships in sopot, poland, in 2014. she was inducted into the association&rsquo;s hall of fame in 2012.   credit  alik keplicz/associated press         szewinska’s next, and last, olympics were not as exciting. she pulled a muscle at the 1980 games in moscow and retired soon after.  irena kirszenstein was born on may 24, 1946, to jakub and eugenia (rafalska) kirszenstein in what was then leningrad, russia. after the end of world war ii the family returned to poland and lived in warsaw, where a teacher first discovered her swiftness at a school competition.  in 1967 she married janusz szewinski, a hurdler and coach who later became a sports photographer. she earned a degree in economics from the university of warsaw in 1970.  in addition to her husband, with whom she lived in lomianki, outside warsaw, her survivors include two sons, andrzej and jaroslaw, and four grandchildren.  after her competitive career ended, szewinska worked for different athletic bodies and became an advocate for female athletes. over the course of her career she was a member of the international olympic committee and the international association of athletics federations’ women’s committee as well as the president of the polish women’s sport association.  szewinska’s olympic medals and world records were not her only honors. she was a five-time gold medalist at the european athletics championships and won more than two dozen times at the polish championships.  she was inducted into the international jewish sports hall of fame in 1981 and the international association of athletics federations’ hall of fame in 2012. four years later she received the order of the white eagle, poland’s highest award.

       " 'seoul, south korea — it was an off night for short-track speedskating at the winter olympics, but everywhere else around south korea, the skating never ends. there are champions to build and rosters to fill for 2022, 2026 and beyond.  two teenage boys, each expecting to be part of the south korean team at the 2022 beijing games, zoomed around the old gwacheon ice rink, heads down, moving as one. as they leaned hard and pumped their legs around one tight corner, a coach held a 9-year-old girl, standing on her skates, by the arms. with perfect timing, he flung her onto the ice, like a fisherman casting a net into the sea.  the rocket boost propelled her to speed and landed her in line with the boys, as if they all wore magnets. three became one. around they went.  like the dozens of others who call the rink home, they practice six days a week, two or three hours each day.        “i have trained abroad,” said lee seung-hwan, the kid-flinging coach and a member of south korea’s long-track speedskating team at the 2002 salt lake games. “i have never seen another country train its children as hard as we do here, from the time they are very young.”            image     lee seung-hwan, a member of south korea’s long-track speedskating team at the 2012 olympics, teaches children speedskating at gwacheon ice rink.   credit  alexandra garcia/the new york times         with its single sheet of ice and pale yellow walls, gwacheon is one of three primary rinks in the seoul area where young skaters are molded into champions.  it is where the figure skater yuna kim, the gold medalist in the 2010 vancouver games, trained, along with several top speedskaters of the past 30 years, including members of this year’s olympic team. in the hallways where boys and girls as young as 5 do their warm-up exercises, not far from the snack stand, glass cases display uniforms, skates and autographed photographs of past champions. there are bronzed hand prints of six of them. a big sign on the wall says, “world star zone.”  one of the display cases is empty, except for a placard.  “are you next?” it reads.  in south korea, figure skating captures the imagination, but speedskating  captures the medals . most winter olympics success comes in the short-track version of racing, that whirling dervish of a sport where power and grace can be upended instantly by minor collisions and mass wipeouts.        before the pyeongchang games, south korea had won 53 medals in its winter olympics history, and 42 were in short-track speedskating. (it was not until these olympics that south korea, part of the winter olympics since 1948, won a medal in a sport that did not include a skate. that was a gold in men’s skeleton, and yun sung-bin is now a national hero.)  it is wildly popular on television, the must-see event of the olympics, and the names of its champions are carved deep in the collective memory.            image        children at gwacheon jump hurdles in a hallway to develop leg strength.   credit  alexandra garcia/the new york times         at these olympics, south korea won three of the eight events in short-track speedskating, and six medals over all in the sport, more than any other country. names like choi min-jeong, shim suk-hee and kim alang (all women) and lim hyo-jun (men’s 1,500 meter winner) and silver-medalist hwang dae-heon joined the pantheon.  like the children at gwacheon ice rink, they were trained as conventional speedskaters until the paths divided — one toward short-track speedskating, with its bursts of power and maneuverability (like driving a ferrari on a go-kart track, as one coach at the rink said), the other toward long track, with its steady, graceful churn against only the clock.  more children than ever are sliding toward long track, their coaches and parents seeing a way toward the medal stand in a less-crowded field. the long-track events continue through saturday, but with one night to go, south korea had five medals. only the netherlands had more.  south korea’s success in skating is unusual because there are not a lot of rinks in the country — a couple dozen regular-sized rinks, plus one long-track oval at taereung national training center, a vast multi-sport complex in seoul. (the oval built in gangneung for the olympics, about 100 miles away, is expected to be converted into a convention center.)        “in a way, it’s a good thing,” lee, the coach, said. “because of these limitations, because of the small numbers, we can really focus our support on these kids. maybe that is a secret to the success.”            image         credit  alexandra garcia/the new york times         the group at gwacheon numbers more than 100, divided into a, b and c groups, depending on ability. the c group is filled with young children, fitted with helmets, taught to crouch low, to cross their right legs over their left and power through corners. about three dozen are in the b group. five are in a, including lee jin-woo, 15, the top skater of his age in the country.  “when i see the olympic athletes go on the podium to get their medals, i feel very jealous, in a good way,” he said.  lee expects to forge his future in long track, the same as lee, his coach (they are not related), did. choosing either short or long track can be difficult at a young age, since almost all training of children is done on regular-sized rinks, like those used for hockey or figure skating.  “we teach the power of how you skate, the speed and control,” said choi sung-hoon, the manager of the physical education department at gwacheon ice rink.        the ability to navigate through crowds, the willingness to bump and grind with other skaters in short track, choi said, is something deep inside some skaters more than others.            image        at gwacheon, more than 100 children train to become speedskaters. they are divided into a, b and c groups, depending on ability.   credit  margaret cheatham williams/the new york times         “i think you are born with that skill,” he said.  outside his office, groups of children jogged warm-up laps up and down the hallway. they crouched beside two-foot hurdles and, when a coach told them, jumped over them and landed in a crouch again.  lee, the coach, wore a strap around his legs, the kind one might use to strap cargo to a car roof, and young skaters in the hall climbed inside the loop and leaned hard to the left, the way they would on the ice, to strengthen their leg muscles. they practiced the right-over-left movements as they side-winded down the hall, as low as they could go, pulling lee with them.  in a training room, children carried each other on their backs and did deep knee bends. they stretched with large rubber bands. even the youngest ones come every day of the week, except monday.  on the ice, figure skaters twirled in the middle of the rink while more than a dozen of the best young speedskaters rushed around them in a single string, moving like a high-speed centipede. lee, the tallest of the juniors, was at the head, in a speed suit with protective glasses on. others followed him like crouching shadows, noses to backsides, mostly descending in size and age, all the way to a 9-year-old girl at the tail.  two corners of the rink had crash pads, in case an accidental slip or trip sent any or all of the children crashing out of line. on this night, it did not happen.            image        young skaters prepare for practice at gwacheon.   credit  alexandra garcia/the new york times         “i’m a little afraid that i will fall,” said park ji-yoon, 11, who wants to be either a teacher or an olympic speedskater when she grows up. “i just follow the person in front of me without thinking.”  the next day, lee, the coach, drove three of his top boys to the national oval, a 45-minute drive across seoul. they make the trip two or three times a week, practicing on the big oval with 200 or more other young skaters, under the tutelage of about 30 coaches, all hoping that they will be in the olympics next time, or the time after that.  tight strings of skaters wove circles around the vast sheet, the ones behind mimicking the one in front, so they all swirled as one, like schools of fish or flocks of birds.  lee jin-woo, the 15-year-old, led the two others from his home rink — jeon min-jae, 14, and an sung-jun, 13. lee, the coach, tracked them through the crowds of other skaters, the strings moving at different speeds. he held a stopwatch and barked orders at them as they glided past. stay synchronized, he shouted near the end of the workout, as their collective rhythm disintegrated.  he knows he is hard on them. he knows that they talk about him when he is out of earshot. he was one of them once, too, before he became an olympian.  “there’s a lot of potential in these kids,” he said. “they’ve already broken the records of the olympians when they were this age.”  the boys came off the ice silently, then into a dressing room to remove their skates and catch their breath. within minutes, they were back in lee’s car, headed across seoul, back to gwacheon ice rink, closer to home.  they were going to practice another hour on the short track.

       " 'gangneung, south korea — the fans at gangneung curling arena stood and waved south korean flags and handmade signs in a salute to their  women’s curling team  and their unexpectedly strong showing at the games.  the final between south korea and sweden already was something like a “miracle on ice” moment, a sporting event that felt like a national pride rally for south koreans.  by the time they outlasted japan in an emotionally draining semifinal, the south korean curlers, called the  “garlic girls”  in the local news media for their pluck and origins in a garlic-growing region, had inspired scores of online tributes from compatriots mimicking them by sweeping the floor with broomsticks in front of their televisions.            image     drawings of the “garlic girls,” as the south korean women’s curling team came to be known, filled the arena at the gold medal game.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         but they would not get their  miracle on ice .  the south koreans succumbed to a more experienced, more skilled swedish team, 8-3, in a match that was conceded before the 10th and final end.        sweden was making its fourth consecutive appearance in the final. it had won in 2006 and 2010 and earned the silver, behind canada, in the 2014 sochi games. this year’s team included one holdover, agnes knochenhauer, from the sochi squad, and she said the pressure that she and her teammates faced in this tournament came from within. “we really wanted to do this,” she said, “and we knew we could if all of us played really well.”  the south koreans faced external pressure to put on a good show in front of their home crowd. they fielded a completely different squad from 2014, when the country made its olympic debut in the event. four of the five team members attended high school in uiseong, roughly 80 miles south of pyeongchang. the city is the nation’s curling center but also its garlic capital.            image        sweden proved to be too much for the south korean curling team in the gold medal match.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         although the “garlic girls” nickname follows them everywhere, the homemade signs ringing the arena gave voice to the team members’ preferred moniker: team kim, a reference to the fact that the four starters, the alternate and their coach share that surname (two of the athletes, kim kyeong-ae and kim yeong-mi, are sisters).        the south korean curlers came across as having a closeness and a camaraderie that was enviable. but in their news conference after the loss, there were hints of the hardships they have endured on their way to becoming olympic darlings. the coach, kim min-jung, became emotional, stopping at one point to compose herself, while speaking of the “issues” they had to overcome.  “it was very hard for me to lead the team properly because the olympic games could be the only chance for the team members,” she said through an interpreter. “so we had to resolve the issues within ourselves.”            image        the leader, or skip, of the south korean curling team, kim eun-jung, right, was comforted after the loss to sweden in the gold medal match.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         asked to elaborate, she said through an interpreter that the country really only got behind curling in 2014, and because it remains less popular than other sports, it has been difficult to obtain the resources to properly develop athletes. as the words rushed out of kim min-jung, the curlers sat next to her on the podium, stone-faced.  the news conference, which began with the moderator announcing that the curlers would not answer “political or sensitive questions,” contained a few lighthearted moments. kim eun-jung, 27, the team skip, essentially a captain on the ice, explained that “eun” means silver in korean. so maybe, she said with a laugh, she should change her name to “geum-jung because geum means gold.”  but then her tone changed. she said the team went through “a lot in order to be successful.”  the curlers’ somber expressions throughout most of the news conference gave the impression the silver medals hung heavy around their necks. their expressions brightened when they left the interview tent and were greeted by men in police bibs and volunteers who clapped and took photographs.  “it was our first time ever to really curl in front of a big audience,” said kim seon-yeong. “all i can say is ‘thank you so much.’”       ',\n",

       " 'moscow — the olympics continue to spin on a wobbly axis, trapped in a vortex of corruption and doping.  who should be held responsible for russia’s systematic doping, which operated furtively at the 2014 winter games in the black sea resort of sochi and was exposed by the same man who masterminded its shadowy effectiveness?  should russia’s olympic committee be made to pay by a forced absence from the 2018 winter games in february in south korea? should all russian athletes be barred from competing there? some of them? how does one decide?  and how much blame should the international olympic committee and the world anti-doping agency share? both have been widely criticized for not spending the necessary effort or money over the years to seriously address the use of performance-enhancing drugs.        such inadequacy has brought a corrosive truth: suspicion of great achievement in olympic sports is rampant. and the innocent find it almost impossible to prove their innocence.  these are the sobering questions facing figure skating. with its alluring mix of athleticism and artistry, it is the centerpiece of the winter games. but as the sport’s olympic buildup began here this weekend on the grand prix circuit, anticipation was tempered by uncertainty.  “olympics without a russian team would look like a meal without salt and pepper,” alexei mishin, a russian coach who has produced three gold medals in men’s skating, said here this week, at the rostelecom cup.  he’s right. russia has the depth to sweep all three medals in women’s skating at the 2018 games. it would also be a favorite in the team skating competition. and soviet and russian pairs have won a gold medal at every olympics but one since 1964.  but the international olympic committee has not yet decided what, if any, punishment should be meted out to russia for its state-sponsored use of banned substances, which involved as many as 1,000 athletes. antidoping agencies from numerous countries, including the united states, have censured the olympic committee for what they view as a refusal to hold russia accountable.        “the i.o.c. has just continued to kick the can down the street, i think, with the hope that it just all goes away,” travis tygart, the chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency, said in a telephone interview.  denis oswald, an i.o.c. delegate from switzerland who is examining the breadth of russian doping, recently told the associated press that he was being prudent, not indifferent.  “you can’t just say they were in sochi and they are russian and they probably were doped,” oswald told the a.p.  several dozen antidoping agencies  have called on the i.o.c . to bar russia’s olympic committee from the 2018 games. they jointly proposed that russian athletes who could show that they have passed rigorous drug testing would be allowed to compete as independent, or neutral, athletes.  grigory rodchenkov, russia’s doping mastermind turned whistle-blower, agreed with the antidoping experts in an article he  wrote recently  for the new york times. he also said that russian athletes should be sequestered in south korea and subjected to stringent testing during the games.  “let’s also be clear that doped athletes in russia are, in many ways, victims, too,” rodchenkov wrote. “in the russian system, they do not have much choice but to cheat, even if some did so enthusiastically.”  in january, samuel auxier, the president of u.s. figure skating, called for russia to be barred entirely from the 2018 games. that seems unlikely, given that some russian athletes were allowed to compete at the 2016 olympics in rio de janeiro. the subject is complicated, and the petition for exclusion is not unanimous.        “i’m all about fair sport, clean sport,” said nathan chen, the only american skater given a real chance to win a gold medal at the 2018 games. but skaters understand imperfection, given that they are judged in a scoring system that is not always comprehensible or equitable. the olympics are about unity, bringing the world together, chen said, not keeping it apart.  “i would love to have them still in the sport,” he said of the russians. “i think that would be weird not to have them.”  chen’s coach is rafael arutyunyan, an ethnic armenian born in the former soviet republic of georgia. he coached for 18 years in moscow before moving to the united states in 2001.  “you can’t kick everybody out because somebody did something wrong,” arutyunyan said. he added: “i spend all my life to train and i’m not allowed to compete? that’s not fair.”  the 2018 games approach even as the 2014 games are not resolved.  an investigation by the world anti-doping agency, known as the mclaren report, confirmed a clever, brazen doping scheme at the sochi olympics: tainted urine samples were slipped through a so-called mouse hole in the drug lab to be laundered like drug money. a steroid concoction known as a duchess cocktail was dissolved in alcohol — whiskey for men, vermouth for women — to enhance absorption and undermine detection.  the mclaren investigation produced circumstantial evidence that raised questions about dozens of russian athletes who competed at the last winter games, including adelina sotnikova, the russian teenager who won the women’s skating competition in sochi. the questions center on whether sotnikova and others were provided with a cocktail of anabolic steroids and had their incriminating urine samples destroyed. but there is no direct evidence of a drug violation, and sotnikova has not been publicly accused.  she was 17 at the time. would she have been aware of russia’s scheme? would she have had the power to say no?        “the problem is, it’s not being followed up on,” tygart said. “there’s no evidence she’s been interviewed. there’s no evidence her coach has been talked to.”  evgenia medvedeva, already a two-time world skating champion at 17, would be russia’s prohibitive favorite to win gold in south korea. has she faced regular drug screening? tygart asked. how often?  the answer from her coach: at each competition and five or six times a year out of competition. this included a morning last week, the coach said, when medvedeva was awakened at 5:30 a.m. to give a urine sample to a collector from the world anti-doping agency.  “it would be really unfair” to keep medvedeva from the olympics, said her coach, eteri tutberidze. “she’s not anything about taking doping. to take away four years, that’s your life.”  others look on warily. brian orser, a two-time olympic silver medalist for canada and coach of the 2014 men’s gold medalist, yuzuru hanyu of japan, watched a documentary about russian doping the other night.  “it makes me angry,” orser said. at the same time, he added, “any global event, if it’s not all-inclusive, it just doesn’t feel the same.” let the russians in, he said, “as long as it’s clean.”  “they have to live with it,” orser said, “for a lot of years after these olympics.”       ',\n",

       " 'dani cameranesi and kelly pannek knew about maddie rooney long before they became teammates on the united states olympic women’s hockey team. they were part of the reason rooney, a goaltender, made the team in the first place.  eleven months ago, cameranesi and pannek, forwards for the two-time defending n.c.a.a. champion minnesota hockey team, were facing rooney and minnesota-duluth in the semifinals of the western collegiate hockey association tournament.  hardly anyone outside the midwest had heard of rooney, a 5-foot-6 sophomore. but she made a team-record 61 saves, many of them acrobatic, in a 2-1, double-overtime upset of the golden gophers.  rooney followed it up with 51 saves the next day against top-ranked wisconsin. that was not enough to deliver the championship; the badgers won, 4-1. but rooney’s tournament-record 112 saves earned her the outstanding player award and the bulldogs their first n.c.a.a. tournament berth since 2011.        cameranesi remembered taking 10 shots on goal against minnesota-duluth. pannek playfully reminded her it was 14. and rooney stopped them all.  “it was one of those days where she was on fire,” cameranesi said. “i’ve come to realize ‘one of those days’ is every single day she’s on the ice. she’s just so amazing.”  the national team added rooney as a backup goalie for the world championships in march, and two months later selected her for the olympic residency camp in wesley chapel, fla.  the question is whether the fast-rising rooney, just 20, can help the united states finally wrest the gold medal from canada, winner of the last four olympic tournaments.  coach robb stauber has not named his starter for the opener against finland on sunday, but no one would be surprised if it was rooney. on the team’s pre-olympic tour, she logged most of the ice time, leading in starts (six), victories (four) and goals-against average (1.83). rooney faced canada five times, winning three games, including the four nations cup final, 5-1, in november. the two losses came in overtime.        “she’s very fast, takes up the bottom of the net really well, and she’s played really well against us,” said canada goaltender shannon szabados, a two-time gold medalist.  minnesotans have been part of every united states olympic women’s hockey team since the first in 1998; this one has seven. but rooney will be the first minnesota-born goaltender. she made it by impressing stauber, the first goalie to win the hobey baker award as college hockey’s top player, in 1988.        image     rooney, 20, played on a boys&rsquo; hockey team during her senior year of high school. &ldquo;i wanted to get the ultimate challenge,&rdquo; she said.   credit  mike ehrmann/getty images       “she’s not a goalie-school goalie,” said stauber, who should know, since he owns a goaltending school. a goalie-school goalie, he said, knows how to stand and move. rooney’s anticipation, he said, sets her apart.  “players can hit corners at 70 and 80 miles an hour, and if they do, you had better have an idea where it’s going before the puck is shot,” he said. “she has that idea. and then you have to have selections or movements that keep the puck from entering the net, and she does.”  rooney strengthened her game by switching from girls’ hockey to boys’ hockey for her senior year at andover high school, near minneapolis.  rooney’s father, mike, approached andover boys’ coach mark manney before the season with the idea. maddie played on boys’ teams for the andover youth hockey association, so her potential teammates knew and liked her.        “i wanted to get the ultimate challenge,” she said. “faster release, faster pace of the game, more physical.”  two games into the season, rooney won the no. 1 job with a scoreless relief effort against spring lake park high, winning, 5-3, after andover fell behind by 3-0 in the second period. her 2.83 goals-against average and .910 save percentage compared favorably to the 2012-13 andover starter chase perry (2.70, .910), a detroit red wings draft pick who is now at rensselaer polytechnic institute. andover finished 10-12-3.  manney has sent five players to division i. none, he said, was more focused or driven than rooney. still, manney said, some questioned his decision to keep her.  “i don’t want to say i took a lot of abuse, but i got opinions from a lot of hockey people who said i was doing a disservice by having her play,” he said. “one, i was taking a spot away from a boy, and two, i was not preparing her for women’s college hockey. i was preparing her for something she might never face. i told those folks, i don’t think college is her ultimate goal.”  minnesota-duluth offered her a scholarship first; laura schuler, the bulldogs’ chief recruiter at the time, coaches canada’s olympic women’s team. last season in college, rooney started all 37 games, finishing 10th nationally in goals-against average (1.65) and fourth in save percentage (.942).  at the world championships, rooney shut out russia in her only appearance. then she started three of the americans’ four games at four nations tournament. rooney’s rise with the national team did not surprise minnesota coach brad frost, whose team eliminated minnesota-duluth in the n.c.a.a. quarterfinals, 1-0.  “last year she was as good as anybody in the country,” he said.  none of stauber’s three goaltenders — rooney, alex rigsby or nicole hensley — has a minute of olympic experience. rooney said she would be ready, thanks in part to the boys of andover.  “the whole experience has been really humbling,” she said. “i’m just trying to take it all in day by day. i can feel myself improving, and i’m looking forward to what’s to come.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the first sign that wind might be a prevalent factor at these winter olympics was visible across the top of the mountains. giant wind turbines dot the highest ridges, like candles on a cake.  the second might have been that a nearby village, a quaint tourist attraction with sledding and sleigh rides, is called uiyaji wind village. “the sight of windmills standing high above the frozen plain are a sight to remember,” according to  a page on the official pyeongchang games website.   and then there was the literature from the organizing committee, boasting that these olympics would be  completely powered  by nearby wind farms.            image     barriers were blown over outside an arena in gangneung on wednesday.   credit  carl court/getty images         so it should have been no surprise when the wind took a silent, starring role at these olympics, rivaling  chloe kim  and  the north korean cheerleading squad . it is an invisible but persistent disrupter, wreaking havoc on everything from  the schedule of the alpine ski events  to the tents and other temporary structures surrounding the ice arenas near the coast.        wind. who could see it coming?  at the start of the olympics last week, wind made  the already bitter cold  more unbearable. the temperatures became milder, but the wind just got more fierce.  it has been a nuisance (ski events keep getting postponed), a danger (the olympic park in gangneung  was evacuated on wednesday  because tents and signs were blowing everywhere) to a novelty (the 20-plus-story apartment towers in the media and the athlete villages swayed enough on wednesday to rock the hangers in the closets).  wind greatly affected the women’s slopestyle snowboard contest on monday, a day after qualifying runs had been canceled because of wind. in the finals, athletes  crashed or essentially gave up on 41 of 50 runs.  some approached the big jumps at full speed, only to pull up at the last moment because snow made it impossible to see or the wind socks on the jumps were completely stiffened. tess coady of australia blamed the wind for a knee injury sustained in a training run before the competition.              “got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my acl was not a big fan!” she  wrote on instagram .  several miles away on monday, the women’s giant slalom competition was postponed, just as the men’s downhill had been the day before. (they both ultimately took place on thursday, the first somewhat still day of the games.)  it threw off training cycles and complicated the hopes of skiers like mikaela shiffrin, the american star who is aiming to win multiple gold medals. because of the wind,  she faced three straight days of races , hardly ideal.  for most of a week, the blowing snow created white-out conditions on the ski courses. gondolas tilted uncomfortably in the wind, and chair lifts were shut down. race flags were blown off their poles. mislaid gloves blew away.            image        workers tried to stop a security tent from blowing away outside the gangneung ice arena on thursday.   credit  aris messinis/agence france-presse — getty images         but wind is a fickle foe to plenty of winter sports, and it has affected all of the outdoor events. on the biathlon course, it was even harder than usual to shoot straight. at the ski jump, the 45-year-old veteran noriaki kasai of japan said he had rarely felt such strong wind at a competition.  “it’s unbelievable,” he said. “the wind howls so loud it’s frightening being up there.”  the wind even put a scare into spectators milling around the complex of ice arenas close to the coast.        “due to high winds in the gangneung area, all activities in the common domain of the gangneung olympic park have been temporarily suspended to ensure the safety of all personnel,” the pyeongchang olympic committee wrote in a statement wednesday afternoon, as temporary tents, booths and fences were upended and blown over in a sudden burst. according to reuters, 13 volunteers and three spectators received minor injuries from flying debris, and 60 tents were damaged.  the area was closed and fans shooed away. the giant circuslike tents that serve as workrooms for members of the news media were emptied.  who knew it could be so windy in such a lovely place? actually, olympic organizers did. the pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee had a “meteorology and climate team” that supplied  a 26-page report about weather , updated last year.  the most dominant pattern this time of year, the report warned, was the “siberian high,” as cold and dry winds from the northwest come with little obstruction all the way from siberia.  “high winds and low windchill temperatures are the most influential factors in particular during the olympic period,” the report said.  that explains the wind turbines.

norway its first men’s downhill gold on thursday.  under a bright sky and a warm sun, svindal turned in a gutsy run on a winding but tame course that was almost perfectly suited to him. his teammate, kjetil jansrud, took the silver medal, finishing 0.12 of a second behind svindal in a triumphant showing for the country that has won more medals than any other at the winter olympics but is better known for its prowess in nordic sports.  beat feuz of switzerland finished 0.18 of a second behind svindal and won bronze.  all three medal winners were lucky enough to be among the first 10 skiers on

skating his way down the initial slope. midway through his run he lost his balance, went upright in the middle of the jump and landed on the back of his skis 20 feet down the hill. svindal somehow regained his stability though and ended up gaining speed on the relatively flat and winding third quarter of the course where so many other races were losing time.        at nearly 6 feet 3 inches and

       " 'three weeks before the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, sports officials are still deliberating which russian athletes will receive special clearance to compete, stirring speculation that the international olympic committee’s ban on russia for its doping schemes will ultimately prove less severe than it was billed.  a panel appointed by the i.o.c. last month has received applications from hundreds of russian athletes who hope to compete in pyeongchang. (because russia’s olympic team is technically barred, the athletes would compete under the olympic flag.) that panel is expected to conclude its review within the next week, ruling on which russians have effectively demonstrated that they are clean and should be given the chance to circumvent the  ban on their nation  for systematic  cheating at the last winter games .  but even once that participant list is established, the 2018 olympic roster will be far from fixed. before the end of the month, an international sports court is due to hear the appeals of  39 russian athletes  whom the i.o.c. barred for having doped at the 2014 games.  future appeals may take issue with the opaqueness of the process by which the i.o.c. is reviewing russian athletes’ eligibility — something a group of antidoping officials criticized forcefully on thursday. after a summit in bonn, germany, officials from 20 nations urged the olympic review panel — which is led by france’s former sports minister and includes representatives from the i.o.c. and the top regulator of drugs in sports — to publish firm standards to be applied consistently to potential olympians from russia.        “robust and demanding criteria, as well as the names of russian athletes with their individual testing histories who have met them, need to be published as soon as possible,” the antidoping leaders said in a statement.  the olympic review panel that will issue invitations to russian athletes is led by valérie fourneyron, france’s former sports minister and the current chairwoman of a new global drug-testing authority created by the i.o.c. it also includes günter younger, the director of intelligence and investigations for the world anti-doping agency who previously worked for interpol in germany; pedro goncalves, a project manager for the doping-free sport unit who is overseeing pre-games testing of all olympic athletes; and richard budgett, the medical and scientific director of the i.o.c.  as pyeongchang’s feb. 9 opening ceremony approaches, the unsettled roster of russian athletes — as well as the friction between sports officials and antidoping enforcers — has echoed the disarray of the last olympics. at the 2016 rio games, russian athletes were presumed tainted by their nation’s state-backed doping program unless they proved otherwise. that prompted a flood of legal disputes, with athletes petitioning to compete even after the games had begun.  the antidoping officials who spoke out thursday — representing countries that included australia, canada, japan and the united kingdom — urged the i.o.c. not to grant entry to any of the hundreds of russian athletes who have been implicated by past investigations into russian doping or by a trove of  drug-testing data  obtained by global sports regulators from moscow last fall.  they called for any russian athletes who are granted competition slots in pyeongchang to have a minimum of one year of rigorous drug-testing outside of russia. russia’s antidoping agency has been deemed noncompliant by the global regulator of drugs in sports for more than two years.        days ago, at a tournament in siberia, three dozen russian athletes abruptly withdrew from a regional competition after drug-testing officials had arrived unannounced, according to russian media. many said they were ill, and russia’s track and field association said it had launched an investigation into the mass withdrawals.  on thursday, the i.o.c. announced that more than 14,000 doping tests had been conducted on over 6,000 athletes from 61 countries “to optimize the protection of clean athletes ahead of pyeongchang.”  “with extra scrutiny on russian athletes, november and december saw testing on double the number of athletes from russia than any other country,” the i.o.c.  statement  said. the organization touted not just a higher volume of tests across countries but the use of intelligence to focus on possible likely violators.  “this more targeted testing focuses on specific disciplines and nationalities that are at particular risk, as well as individual athletes and groups of athletes selected based on their ranking, and any suspicious change in performance or adverse testing history,” the statement said.  russian athletes implicated in the nation’s doping scandal have continued to compete not just nationally but also in global competitions. on thursday, the antidoping officials urged olympic executives not to grant entry to any russian athlete with a pending disciplinary case.  numerous such russian olympians whom the i.o.c. has barred for cheating at the 2014 games have continued to compete in their sports’ major international competitions this season and dominate standings. some have qualified for the olympics though they are prohibited to attend them — skewing global rankings and precluding other athletes from qualifying for their countries’ olympic teams. in certain sports with unique qualification rules, barred athletes have earned points for their nation that could enable another russian athlete to have a place at the games.  russian officials, including president vladimir v. putin, have decried the olympic ban while signaling satisfaction that russian athletes will still be able to compete with a reference to their nationality, each identified as an “olympic athlete from russia.”        on wednesday, the russian equivalent of the f.b.i.  pushed back  on factual conclusions that had informed the i.o.c. ban, disputing scientific analysis of urine samples and again questioning the credibility of whistle-blower witnesses.  “the i.o.c. claims to have banned the entire russian olympic committee, and they’re examining the basis on which they should invite any russian athletes,” said travis t. tygart, the chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency, who was among the officials who met in germany this week and spoke out on thursday.  “if there are 232 russian athletes in pyeongchang — the same number that was in sochi — then the i.o.c. will have pulled off a total scam.”       ',\n",

measure, norway won the men’s race the next day, coming from behind again.             image        adam rippon in the men\\'s free skate. he finished 10th in the singles competition and helped the

immediately after they’re done competing, are seldom places of high profundity. imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. but then along came the walking book of quotations known as  adam rippon , whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.  rippon, who competed in the men’s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. after his free skate in the men’s singles, rippon, one of two openly gay men on the united states olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don’t embrace him.        “haters are just fans in denial,” rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.            image         xu mengtao of china during the

competition, i had the chance to photograph the women’s aerials finals at phoenix snow park.  it was my first visit to the venue, and the photo manager told me that during practice he allowed photographers to stand underneath the ramp   off which the skiers launch themselves. normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. this vantage point gave an entirely different view.  one cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one’s attention. a speaker announces, “athlete on course,” and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.  as they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. as the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.            image        jingyu lee and yoonjung park  of the

games, the unified korea women’s ice hockey team was pretty battered, not just on the ice, but by intense political and news media attention. yet after the team’s final game, against sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, “we are one!”        then the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 seoul games, “ hand in hand ,” blared across the arena. the last player on the ice was goalie shin so-jung, who let in four goals that night. she left to a standing ovation from the crowd.            image        choi min-jeong of south korea after winning the 1,500-meter short-track speedskating race.   credit  hilary swift for the new york

korea’s favorite sports .  but you did not have to be in the arena to understand what short track means to the host country. during the last night of competition, i was on a high-speed train from seoul to the olympic city of gangneung. my reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. i bemoaned my bad timing: i would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. then i caught a glimpse of the man’s smartphone. he was watching the live broadcast. i turned to the woman. she was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.            image        aljona savchenko and bruno massot of germany after their stunning long program.    credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         a perfect comeback   jere longman:  aljona savchenko and bruno massot of germany, who were among the favorites in the  pairs figure skating  competition, fell to fourth after the short program when massot made a jumping mistake. he seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.  but they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. afterward, having poured everything into the routine, savchenko, who was competing in her fifth olympics, collapsed to the ice. massot went to his knees and hugged her. and they won the gold medal.        until november, massot’s eligibility to compete for germany had been in doubt. he is a native of france who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain german citizenship. germany’s president, frank-walter steinmeier, visited the skaters during the games. massot later confessed to a friend, “i couldn’t understand everything he said.”            image        ivett toth during her sizzling, and chilly, tribute to

toth of hungary wasn’t skating to the same old songs. nothing from “carmen” or “swan lake.” not one of those go-to figure skating songs that i’d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first winter games in 2002.  this was the first olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and toth’s choice was classic — classic rock, that is.  her music had the rafters shaking. it was ac/dc’s “ back in black ,” and toth was dressed as a    biker. she wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of ac/dc’s lead guitarist, angus young, on the back. she also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. it was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.  as the music suggested, toth rocked it. half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to ac/dc’s “ thunderstruck ,” a staple of n.f.l. games. the other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. i swear that i could see the judges growing pale.  toth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.  when toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. she went with “carmen.”            image        joe ward, left, with doug mills, whom he calls one of

all the more memorable.  doug snapped the famous photograph of president george w. bush being told about the attacks on the world trade center in a florida classroom. the multitudes of people who admire mills’s photographs don’t also get to experience his generosity and humor. some days, more than others, you realize you’re lucky to be doing what you’re doing.            image        artur

grandchildren and wants to tell them about his olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.  in the men’s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. it lasted for two seconds. nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.  if records were kept for “shortest amount of time in the games when you were in contention,” this guy would be hard to beat.        he didn’t stay on the ground for long. while the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete’s nightmare.  the audience applauded. it sounded nothing like the applause for cha min kyu, a south korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.            image        family and fans of anna gasser of austria celebrate her win in the women\\'s big air snowboarding final.    credit  hilary swift for the new york times         a visual cue from the roar of the crowd   bedel saget:  as a visual journalist, i find it interesting that my favorite moment of the pyeongchang games was a strictly audible one. for the  women’s big air fina l, i was shooting from a position where i could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (ask the silver medalist, jamie anderson, who couldn’t hold onto first place after failing to land her “cab double cork 1080” in the final round.)  i followed as best as i could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. by the third and final round, i had a strong feeling that the austrian anna gasser — the reigning world champion and favorite whom i’d followed for an entire year for one of our  olympic preview interactive  graphics — would land somewhere on the podium.  the stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, i sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. after she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. gasser had won the first gold medal in olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women’s snowboarding. it was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.            image        vice president mike pence of

geopolitics, and gold   randal c. archibold:  in one night, i saw south korea win its  first gold medal , vice president mike pence and his  entourage  push past me, and the north korean  cheerleading squad  execute “the wave” with robotic precision.  who knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?  it was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where i helped edit our coverage and to go see something. the other events i attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. so the first olympic event i have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.            image        who let this guy come to the top of the jump?   credit  doug mills/the new york times         an olympic veteran reaches new heights   doug mills:  without a doubt, my pinch-me moment came when i was allowed to spend time up in the ski jumpers’ start house. this is a place i had never visited while photographing several other games, and i had not seen many photos made from inside.  i would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. it’s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but i know one thing: there is no way i could do what these olympic athletes do.            image        \"as long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the norwegian men at the train station.   credit  inyoung kang         norwegian fans help make the world smaller   inyoung kang:  i was waiting for the 8:24 train back to seoul when i heard the two men coming — laughing, chattering, clanking. they were covered in norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their viking plushies.         i gawked for a moment before asking if i could take their picture.  “of course!” they said in unison, beaming and posing.  i snapped a photo and asked if they were in pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. in the station, i had met a swede who had come to support his daughter, an alpine skier.  “no, we are just fans,” one said. he gestured at his friend’s get-up. “we came here for fun. as long as we can make people smile, we are happy.”  the first olympics i remember watching were the nagano games in 1998. as a child, i was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. now, 20 years later, i was in the country of my parents’ birth to cover my first olympics. i have always felt a bit like an outsider — a minority at home or a foreigner with an american accent here. but that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to korea, the world felt a little smaller. i thanked the norwegians, and we parted ways.             image        at the finish of the team sprint, jessie diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for team u.s.a., clinching its first gold in cross country.   credit  dmitri lovetsky/associated press         because minnesota   talya minsberg:  “because minnesota.” that’s a reason i was assigned to follow the united states women’s cross country team throughout the winter games. both  jessie diggins  and i grew up in minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the twin cities.  diggins and the other american women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing — the first for the united states since bill koch took home a silver in 1976.        on feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. on feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just    3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. and when the stands were the fullest, on feb. 17, the american team of sophie caldwell, sadie bjornsen, kikkan randall and diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.  when asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so    many narrow misses, diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, “if i didn’t, i wouldn’t be here.”  on wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: “want to chase cross country one more time?”  the race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in olympic highlight reels for years. diggins and randall didn’t just win a medal. they took the gold.             image        the pyeongchang crowds approached the olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination.     credit  hilary swift for the new york times         some of the best pictures are not of athletes   hilary swift:  one of my favorite days at the olympics was the qualifying runs for women’s big air snowboarding. it was probably the warmest day i can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.   my colleague doug mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so i was free to roam the crowd and look for features. to me, this photo speaks to what the olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. you may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you’re supporting your country’s athletes and    others from all over the world.            image        the media buses at the olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the games.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         pardon the delay while my country races   andrew keh:  a bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.  right then, lee sang-hwa of south korea was inching toward the starting line in the women’s 500-meter speedskating event. lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, nao kodaira of japan. as lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.  bus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the olympics running. but every so often, when a korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. the passengers never seemed to mind.  two days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the south korean women’s curling    win over the united states team. some passengers clapped as the women,    unexpected stars of the games, celebrated on screen. the driver laughed out loud.  “wow, they really are good,” he said to no one in particular. then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.            image        michelle gisin of switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the alpine combined a few days later.     credit  doug mills/the new york times         exceptional on the slopes, normal on the bus   tara parker-pope:  for me, the best part of the olympics happened    between competitions, when i would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. i struck up a conversation with the swiss skier michelle gisin on a bus —     about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister dominique won a gold medal in sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.  gisin was charming and humble. we traded pins, and i wished her luck. a week later she stormed to a gold medal in the alpine combined. at my hotel, i ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder jamie anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. “you know jamie?” her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.   it’s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing    exceptional things.            image        two old friends, matthew futterman, left, and jason albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day.   credit  gabby naranja         is that you, jason?   matthew futterman:  the olympic games are supposed to be about bringing people together.   as a student at union college in schenectady, n.y., i spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named jason albert. we called him “j-bert” back then. a lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?  we spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating    problems large and small — iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.  on graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, “see you soon.”  we didn’t. that was nearly 27 years ago. there is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to bend, ore., and me to the upper west side of manhattan.        the day before the olympics started, as i was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, i nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great nordic sports website fasterskier.com — my old friend and housemate jason.  in that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches — thankfully, without very much to complain about.            image        from

  the best bobsled picture has no bobsled   chang w. lee:  this is my favorite picture from these olympics.  it’s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many olympic sports, especially bobsled.  one day as i walked down from the top of the sledding hill, i could barely see anything. there were spots where i could see some parts of the track, with the olympic village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn’t make for very good pictures.   i kept walking down. still, nothing much. the competition went on, and i didn’t have a picture yet. i heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. when i had nearly reached the bottom, i saw a gap in the course. i peeked into it. i tried looking for several different groups of fans, but i    didn’t see much in the way of reactions.   then, there we go. i made the best picture of sliding sports i have ever seen, even without a bobsled.        three fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. just three fans. you could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.            image        ester ledecka of the czech republic stood stunned after winning the women’s super-g alpine race.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         did i really just do that?   bill pennington:  the outcome of the women’s super-g alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. or so it seemed. the top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time    had already been recorded.  then  ester ledecka  of the czech republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. when she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. there was a no. 1 next to her name.  other racers and the audience    were as stunned as ledecka. but not    three czech fans in the grandstand. they began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.  ledecka was sure it was a mistake. much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.  but there was no error, and bit by bit, the three czech fans had a contagious effect on    those around them. the cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. it almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth — and celebrated the capricious spirit of the olympics.

       " 'when the russian olympic team was barred from the coming winter games for running a doping program, the ruling by the international olympic committee raised a host of important questions.  can it be considered the most elaborate doping conspiracy in sports history? how many olympic events were corrupted by russian athletes using illicit substances? and, for any athletes from russia who manage to get special dispensation to participate as neutral athletes in the 2018 pyeongchang games, what will the textile specifications be for their uniforms?  the international olympic committee has now answered some of those questions, in excruciating and glorious detail.  russian athletes who convince sports officials that they are clean and were not part of the doping conspiracy will get to compete at the winter games, but will not officially be representing russia. instead, these athletes will be known as “olympic athletes from russia.” and the i.o.c. clearly plans to be vigilant that the word “russia” doesn’t make too big of an appearance at the games.        under rules announced on wednesday, with surprisingly little fanfare, russian athletes’ and officials’ uniforms and equipment can say only two things: “olympic athlete from russia” or the abbreviation “o.a.r.”            image     the official logo for the russian olympic team that shall not be known as the russian olympic team but rather a neutral team (from russia) at the winter games in february.        olympics officials, showing great savvy, got out in front of any efforts at typographical shenanigans. “print size for words ‘olympic athlete from’ should be equivalent to the word &#x27;russia,’” the i.o.c. said, thwarting any delightfully clever attempt to print a tiny “olympic athlete from” dwarfed by a jumbo “russia,” a tactic likely proposed by several 9-year-olds.  the russians can also forget about doing something fancy with their new designation. fonts should be “as generic as possible.” so no bubble letters that would garner global support for the russian athletes who are not officially russian athletes but rather neutral athletes (from russia).  the announcement included a proposed logo for russia, with the words “olympic athlete from russia” in a bland red circle almost designed to sell as little merchandise as possible.        the russian flag’s colors are red, white and blue, but the neutral athletes’ uniforms can’t have all three colors at these games. “only single or dual color elements are permitted,” the i.o.c. said in a document that somehow has not yet gone viral in the textile rules community. but what if the top was red and white and the pants blue? nope. “separate items of clothing cannot create a tricolor.”  yes, you read that correctly, olympic officials even barred the neutral athletes (from russia) from creating a tricolor, surely an olympic first.  in fact, let’s steer clear of russian red, white and blue entirely, shall we? “the colors used in uniforms, accessories and equipment may not be in exactly the same pantone as those used in the russian federation flag.” the i.o.c. helpfully advises: “it is suggested that these are darker in color.”  the i.o.c. is obviously taking great pains to ensure that everyone knows that these “olympic athletes from russia” are most definitely, positively not russian olympic athletes. everyone clear?

       " 'who else is enthralled by this holiday season’s blockbuster drama, putin vs. bach?  it’s a cold war-era redux starring vladimir v. putin, the president of russia, and thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee — two leaders who answer to no one.  bach’s reputation, not to mention the credibility of his august organization, was wounded by russia’s audacious doping program. he has just a short time left to decide how to save face. putin, who calls the whole thing a western conspiracy, has all but publicly dared bach to respond with force.  they are in a standoff, nose-to-nose, shirt sleeves rolled up, each waiting for the other to blink.  the olympic committee will announce on tuesday how it is punishing russia for one of the most ambitious and delicious (see its steroid cocktail recipe  here ) doping schemes in sports history. many people outside russia seem to believe that barring the russians entirely from the pyeongchang games is fair and necessary, considering they corrupted the outcomes on the playing field and  stole medals from clean athletes  in several olympics — most notably the winter games they hosted in sochi, in 2014.  if only bach’s reasoning were that linear.  the olympic committee has a long track record of being too timid and much too slow in making strong decisions on sensitive subjects, especially when dealing with powerful nations that use sports to show off their strength. (see  internet censorship  at the 2008 beijing games or  the issue of russia’s anti-gay legislation  before the sochi games.) when upset, those nations have the ability to shake the olympic movement to its core.        many russian officials remain defiant — great acting? — despite enough evidence to fill a halfpipe. the kremlin spokesman  dmitry peskov recently said  that there had never been any state-backed doping in russia. on the same day, the russian olympic committee posted photos  on its twitter page  of models wearing shirts with the words, “i don’t do doping,” when it unveiled its olympic apparel.  and  putin said in early november  that the doping bans involving russians were just an american scheme to make him look bad before elections in march.  what happens if bach sides with clean athletes, the real victims here, and gives russia more than a slap on the wrist? the russians have threatened to boycott the pyeongchang games, a take-our-ball-and-go-home gesture that would elicit little sympathy considering how many non-russian athletes were deprived of olympic glory in sochi for the wrong reasons.  even if the olympic committee allows ostensibly clean russian athletes to compete under a neutral flag — without any russian symbols, such as its flag or anthem — the russians will stay home, they’ve said. they won’t televise the olympics, and  they would block players from the kontinental hockey league,  an international hockey league based in russia that is second in importance only to the national hockey league, from competing in pyeongchang. keeping those players — who are from many nations — from the olympics would further dilute the hockey competition after  the n.h.l. said its players would not participate .  spoiler alert: some insiders say this thing is going to fizzle.  “it’s just posturing,” said harvey schiller, who has worked in the olympic movement for decades, including during the boycotts in the 1980s. “russia has used the olympics to make a strong political statement, so they want to compete. they would love to win the gold medal in hockey. and with the boycotts in the ’80s, everybody knows that it hurt both sides.”        on the issue of russia keeping its k.h.l. players out of the games, schiller said there would be enough pressure from the international hockey federation to keep russia from barring the players from pyeongchang.  in a curious plot twist, the president of the k.h.l. is  dmitry chernyshenko , who was in charge of the sochi games. after sochi, he stood on a grand patio that overlooked some of the games’ venues near the black sea, puffed out his chest and told me he was so proud of how russia delivered what he called perfect games.  that was all before the world found out what russia truly had pulled off at those games, and before the country’s  resulting tumble  down the medals standings.  can bach divine a way to punish russia — like,  really  punish russia — without triggering a boycott? that’s not an easy thing to do. it’s his second trip to the plate on this, and  last time he struck out  without even trying to swing.  before the 2016 rio games, he and the olympic committee had  seemingly ample information  on the russian doping program, but he took the easy way out, deferring to the international sports federations to decide the fate of their athletes.            image     russia’s delegation at the athletes’ welcome ceremony before the 2016 rio games. the i.o.c. asked various sports federations to determine whether russia’s athletes were eligible to compete in rio.   credit  david ramos/getty images         now, several investigations later, all of that early evidence has been verified and reverified, and  new material  has been added to the pile. bach even has reports from two investigations commissioned by his own organization. can he possibly flinch?        in an interview with the new york times last month, he said, “nobody will be happy, and that is maybe a good sign.”  it was an echo of what he said less than two weeks before the rio games, after tossing the hot potato to the federations. “this may not please everybody on either side,” he said then of a decision that most certainly pleased russia, since many of its athletes were allowed to compete in the summer games despite a report detailing extensive doping.  so this is a sequel, in a way. how will it end? the climax is tuesday. pop some popcorn. grab some junior mints.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — if you’re an american, you are likely to see the winter olympics through the lens of nbc: a healthy dose of figure skating, shaun white, mikaela shiffrin, chloe kim.  but there are places where skating raises a yawn, and fans thrill to the anticipation of the nordic combined or skeleton competitions.  here’s how some other countries are seeing the games.  south korea  in the host country, it’s all about short-track speedskating, especially for women. shim suk-hee and choi min-jeong are going to contend in just about every event.  more generally, said lee sung-han of the yonhap news agency, the country has shown a “concentration on ice-related sports, not as much on snow events.”        skeleton was not too popular five to 10 years ago, but thanks to the gold medal hopes of yun sung-bin, it is attracting attention this time around.  but a medal is not mandatory for interest. the women’s ice hockey team, which will  include a few players from north korea , will be a hot topic, regardless of its results, lee said.              germany  in germany, the suite of popular sports includes a number barely registering in the united states.  biathlon, which nicolas reimer of sport-informations-dienst called “the formula one of the winter,” was always popular, but it grew even bigger with the success of laura dahlmeier, who won five gold medals at the 2017 world championships.  reimer also ticks off “luge, the women for sure. ski jumping will be big.” but he worries about nordic combined. germans “won everything last season. this season they are a little bit weak.”        still, the country will be watching.  sweden  cross-country skiing will be the most popular sport, “no doubt,” said karl forssell of expressen sweden. “charlotte kalla is the most popular athlete by a big margin.”  kalla has parlayed cross-country fame into endorsement deals for electric toothbrushes and vegetarian meat substitutes.  ice hockey is huge in sweden, and after it was announced that n.h.l. players would not participate this year, “there was less interest,” he said. “but when the tournament is on ... it’s sweden. if they can get into the semifinals, people will watch.”  japan  the country’s biggest star, and one of the world’s biggest, is the defending men’s figure skating champion yuzuru hanyu.  but it’s not just hanyu. figure skating is “far more popular than the other sports,” said daisuke hasegawa of kyodo news. “there are enthusiastic fans who go around the world for figure skating events. so many japanese fans will be here for hanyu.”  only baseball and soccer can rival figure skating’s popularity, hasegawa said.  britain  as in the united states, interest in winter sports skyrockets in britain every four years. one in particular. “every time the games come on, curling goes bonkers,” said ed langford of team g.b. “it’s a national obsession for a fortnight.”        short-track speedskating has also drawn a following “because of one athlete,” elise christie, who could win a medal.  the freestyle skiers and snowboarders in big air and slopestyle events could also become national darlings.  canada  canada has the second-biggest delegation to these games and a strong team in a number of sports. among the biggest stars, said photi sotiropoulos, the team’s press secretary, will be the ice dancers scott moir and tessa virtue — “the nicest people you’ll ever meet” — and the freestyle skier mikael kingsbury. but as you might expect, hockey is still the king. even without n.h.l. players, interest will be very high in both the men’s and women’s events, sotiropolous said.  australia  australians will be looking to the newer events for their stars this year, especially the freestyle skiing and snowboard events, said geoff lipshut, the deputy chief of mission.  among them is the snowboarder scotty james, who carried the nation’s flag in the opening ceremony.  the pairs skater harley windsor is likely to attract a lot of attention, too. he is the first aboriginal australian to compete at a winter games.  and every four years, there is interest in short-track speedskating, lipshut said. that’s largely because of the story of steven bradbury, who took gold at the salt lake city games in 2002 when everyone else fell down. the memory is so sharp in australia that people still tune in, perhaps hoping for a repeat.

       " 'gangneung, south korea — the winter olympics are a global competition, with athletes representing 92 countries. but one event is dominated by americans and canadians like no other: zamboni driving.  it is conspicuous, this army of 37 mostly imported zamboni drivers, doing their quiet, mesmerizing work of resurfacing the ice, back and forth on their big machines, when the action pauses and the cameras turn away.  “i have really good american drivers,” said remy boehler, an ice expert from france in charge of the surfaces for the figure skating and short-track speedskating arena and practice rinks. “for me, it is a dream team.”        ice is hardly a foreign substance in south korea, especially when it’s this cold, yet when it comes to making it and resurfacing it, the pyeongchang olympics organizing committee outsourced it to foreign experts.            image     the names of the zambonis are pork belly, soju and kloud after local food and beverages. skotheim recently marked soju as having its blade changed.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         can’t anyone else around here drive a zamboni?  the answer is more complicated than a simple yes or no. it has to do with the small pool of zamboni drivers in south korea and the three men, none of them korean, hired by the pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee to oversee the ice at the venues. each wanted to assemble an olympic-caliber crew.  “i look for two things: someone who is competent operating a zamboni, and someone who wants to be part of a team,” said mark messer, a canadian in charge of the ice at the gangneung oval, home of speedskating, and working his seventh olympics. “we’re immersed in this — eight guys, together 16 hours a day. unless you have good chemistry, it’s got the possibility of running off the rails.”  to keep the zambonis running straight, messer built his team with six canadians and an american. as if to give their work a local flavor, they christened their three shiny zambonis with names of things they have consumed in their rare off-hours: pork belly, soju (the omnipresent korean liquor) and kloud (a korean beer).  the experts say that driving a zamboni takes more skill and experience than fans may realize, and the deepest, most experienced pool is in the united states and canada.            image        messer, a canadian, is in charge of the ice at the gangneung oval, home of speedskating.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         “i can teach anybody to drive the zamboni,” said don moffatt, overseeing a team of 16 drivers at the ice hockey arena, “but it takes many, many years to learn how to actually operate it and operate it properly.”  the olympics, he added, “are not a place to train people.”  but it is a place where the public-address system routinely plays the rink classic “i wanna drive the zamboni” during hockey intermissions.  (let’s pause for an important lesson in ice-related nomenclature: not all ice resurfacers are zambonis, the way not all tissues are kleenex, but these are, with their logos concealed because of olympic sponsorship rules. and zamboni drivers generally prefer fancier titles, like “ice technician,” because making ice is a serious science. but they also are used to being called zamboni drivers, and that is what their bosses here call them, and everyone loves zamboni drivers, especially the kids, so let’s go with that. onward.)   zamboni is based in california , and 17 of its machines are in use at the olympics. if the drivers were athletes, the nation of zamboni would be the 22nd-largest contingent at the games. altogether, 15 are from the united states and eight are from canada. south korea supplied nine drivers, most working the practice rinks. five are from japan. only one, barbara bogner from colorado, is a woman.            image        luke janetzki operating a machine to take away excess water or snow left behind after a zamboni passes.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         they work for the three ice managers (often called the chief of ice or the ice meister) at four competition venues — two arenas for hockey, one for long-track speedskating and one for both figure skating and short-track speedskating. there are also two practice rinks for hockey, a training center for short-track and a practice rink for figure skating.        filling the roster with south korean drivers proved difficult.  south korea has only a couple of dozen rinks, organizers said, so the talent pool of top drivers is small. and no rinks have two ice-resurfacing machines. multiple zambonis on the ice simultaneously can be a seductive dance to watch, but terrifying to drive.  there were other limiting factors in securing local talent. some could not get the six or eight weeks off that the job required. and without firm post-olympic plans for several venues (the speedskating oval, for example, is likely to be converted to convention space), there was little opportunity for locals to find lasting employment by learning during the olympics and taking over the ice-making operation afterward, as happened in places like vancouver and salt lake city.  moffatt used an all-korean crew during hockey test events here last year, with the idea he might do the same during the olympics. he discovered that younger korean drivers deferred to older drivers, afraid to disrespectfully show them up with their skills. but five of them had enough talent, he thought, to be invited to the olympics.  “with us non-koreans, there is less of that,” moffatt said. “still some, but less.”  mainly, the ice chiefs found trusted drivers by tapping into connections at home. most of those at the hockey venues work at n.h.l. arenas in places like edmonton, st. paul and denver. at the figure skating and short-track speedskating sites, most drivers work smaller arenas or oversee the ice operations at recreation centers. those at the long-track oval have specific experience in ovals, which require a more pristine sheet of ice.  “it has to be absolutely perfect,” said paul golomski, whose job at home is facility director of pettit national ice center in milwaukee. “thickness is critical. the amount of speed they’re carrying, the ice has to be perfectly flat.”  every ice sport demands a different surface, with variations in thickness, temperature and hardness. at gangneung ice arena, boehler split his crew between figure skating and short-track specialists. figure skating requires thicker, softer ice. short-track needs colder ice, but not too brittle that it gives way on the tight corners.        beyond the complex refrigeration systems, zambonis are the primary tool in making the ice and keeping it in good condition, a big machine that does a lot of detail work.            image        “i can teach anybody to drive the zamboni,” said don moffatt, who is overseeing a team of 16 drivers at the ice hockey arena, “but it takes many, many years to learn how to actually operate it and operate it properly.”   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         “i could give you a five-minute tutorial, and you could drive the zamboni out there,” messer said, nodding to the huge, glassy oval. “but you’re not going to understand the effect of turning the blade up or down, which controls how much you shave, which can make or break the ice. or how much wash water you’re using, the amount of water you’re using for flooding, where the low spots are on the rink, where the high spots are.”  language can be a barrier. the trickiest place is gangneung ice arena, where boehler, the ice maker, is french. (his first olympics assignment was driving for the albertville games in 1992.) responsibility for clear communication fell to lee hee-soo, a korean student fluent in korean, english and french. she follows boehler as he instructs his crew.  “for the japanese,” boehler said with a thick accent, “we use the language of the hand.”  the other relationship that took some getting used to was that between drivers and machines, part of the reason most drivers arrived in january. most zambonis at the olympics are the new model 650, an electric version that has a slightly wider wheel base and a curvier body style than typical models found in north american rinks.  “the controls are mostly the same, but it changes all the sight lines, and all the overlaps that we’d usually do,” messer said. “so it changes the whole ballgame right there.”            image        the olympic zamboni drivers, most of them from canada and the united states, toasting the end of the day. like athletes, they see the games as the pinnacle of their profession.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         zamboni drivers, like athletes, see the olympics as the pinnacle of their profession. the ice chiefs, fully understanding the importance of perfect ice, are putting only their top drivers on the ice during competitions. in hockey, the ultimate honor is to drive for the men’s gold medal game, but the pair has not been chosen.  nerves have been known to overwhelm lesser drivers, like someone moffatt worked with once at a figure skating world championship.  “this one guy got on the machine the first time, full crowd, drove one lap, just about destroyed the whole ice sheet, and drove off the ice and said, ‘i’m out of here,’” moffatt said. “never saw him the rest of the two weeks. so you never know how people are going to react.”  ryan hevern of minnesota is one of the zamboni drivers for hockey. he learned to drive from his father, whose “claim to fame,” hevern said, was having “his ice” appear in the movie “the mighty ducks.”  “he texts me every couple of nights,” hevern said. his voice hitched. “i get choked up even thinking about it. he’s very proud.”  around and around it goes.

       " 'north korea has  agreed to send a team  to the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea next month.  while the decision may help defuse nuclear tension with the west, in terms of sports, it is unlikely to bring the emergence of a hidden-away north korea version of shaun white or  yuzuru hanyu .  it is not known how many north koreans will wind up participating. but the athletes who do are not likely to shake up the medal table.  so far, north korea has qualified only two athletes for the games,  t he  figure skating pair  of ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik. they missed a deadline to apply for a spot, but that is expected to be overlooked. the international olympic committee has also indicated a willingness to grant some wild-card entries to other north korean athletes.  ryom and kim were 15th at the last world championships, and few expect them to improve much on that performance at the games.        beyond ryom and kim, the prospective crop of athletes are mostly unknown on the international scene. many recent world championships in winter sports, including the traditional korean strengths of short and long track speedskating, have had no north korean entrants at all.  although it is possible that north korea has a hidden gem — its 1964 speedskating silver medalist, han pil-hwa, came out of nowhere — it seems as if most of its athletes will be destined for also-ran finishes.  the biggest impact by the north korean delegation at pyeongchang might be by the cheerleading squad or performance art group it plans to send.  north korea has attended winter games sporadically, starting in 1964. it has won two medals, a silver in speedskating in 1964 and a bronze in short-track speedskating in 1992.  north korea failed to qualify any athletes four years ago. in 2010, its two athletes, a figure skater and a speedskater, did not finish better than ninth.        north korea has been much more successful in the summer games. it has competed in them since 1972, though it boycotted the 1984 games in los angeles and the 1988 games in seoul. it has won 54 medals, 16 of them gold, in events including weight lifting, wrestling, gymnastics and boxing.  it won two gold and seven total medals in 2016 in rio de janeiro. both of its winners, in gymnastics and weight lifting, were the favorites going in.  in november 1987, nearly a year before the summer games in seoul, a south korean airliner exploded, killing more than 100 people. western intelligence agencies say north korea was responsible and the united states considers it a terrorist attack. just last month, foreign policy magazine ran  a disquieting headline : “will north korea blow up the winter olympics?”  though we are unlikely to hear the north korean anthem next month, the attendance of its athletes surely comes as a relief to olympics organizers.

getty images         soares could not be reached for comment. his whereabouts is unknown.  the sprawling, french-led investigation into the attribution of major sporting events, including the 2020 summer olympics in tokyo and several track and field championships, has not formally implicated any banks or bankers. the allegations have similarities with the decades-long global soccer corruption schemes unmasked by united states authorities in may 2015, which led to the arrests of several senior officials for trading their influence for millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.  in the soccer corruption case, american authorities have scrutinized numerous banks through which bribe payments traveled, but none of those financial institutions have been publicly charged. one swiss banker, however, has been convicted of money laundering conspiracy for having facilitated the transfer of tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to soccer officials.        nine days before i.o.c. members gathered in copenhagen, denmark, to declare rio the winner in a competition that also included chicago, madrid and tokyo, soares’s company, called matlock, attempted to transfer $2 million from an account it held in the british virgin islands to a société générale account in france controlled by papa massata diack, according to the documents. five days later, on sept. 28, the money was sent back by the bank. under french law, the bank should have reported the transaction with tracfin, a national watchdog for suspicious transactions.  on sept. 29, soares used a matlock bank account in miami to make two separate payments totaling $2 million to accounts held by papa massata diack directly or by his company pamodzi consulting. those accounts were in société générale-affiliated banks in russia and senegal, where diack is currently living.  “analysis of these flows suggests that the first transfer, due to its amount and its geographical origin, could be blocked in france in application of anti-money laundering rules,” according to the documents.  “this would explain why it was immediately followed by split transfers on behalf of the same company based in miami, from another bank account, to two subsidiaries of the société générale based in countries that were more complacent in the matter of anti-money laundering.”  in their communication with their brazilian counterparts, the french prosecutors said they had yet to determine “the level of involvement of the bank.”            image        lamine diack led track and field’s governing body for 16 years through 2015.   credit  ian walton/getty images         it is unclear what level of cooperation the bank has provided. since july, the investigation has been transferred from the parquet national financier, france’s financial crimes investigator, to magistrate renaud van ruymbeke, a specialist in financial corruption.        van ruymbeke traveled to rio last month and was present when the authorities there  raided the home  of carlos arthur nuzman, the longtime head of brazil’s olympic committee, and a crucial architect of the 2016 bid. authorities accused nuzman of being the central pillar of a scheme — along with the former rio governor sergio cabral and soares — to buy votes from african members of the i.o.c.  the african votes would have represented about 10 percent of the total cast for rio in 2009. the city’s bid had the lowest technical score from the i.o.c. of the four final bidders in copenhagen. it beat out madrid by 66-32 in a final round of voting after chicago and tokyo had been eliminated.  “nuzman was the agent responsible for bringing together interested parties, making contacts and oiling relationships to organize the mechanisms for transferring cabral’s bribes directly to african members of the international olympic committee, which was effectively done by way of arthur soares,” rio prosecutors said in a statement at the time. nuzman has emphatically denied any involvement. he has not been arrested.  soares is the subject of an international arrest warrant; cabral is serving 45 years in prison for a string of corruption-related crimes, including some tied to projects linked to the olympics and soccer’s world cup, held in brazil in 2014.  winning the olympics was hailed by rio’s bid leaders as an unparalleled opportunity to transform the city on a scale not seen in decades, and to improve the lives of millions of the coastal metropolis’s poorest citizens. instead it turned into “an enormous trampoline for corruption,” the brazilian prosecutor fabiana schneider said last month. going into the final vote for selection, rio was not considered the favorite but won, according to schneider, despite being “the worst candidate.”  investigators have tracked several transactions made from the société générale-affiliated accounts linked to papa massata diack, including on the day rio was picked to host the olympics. they include more than $250,000 to jewelry businesses in paris and qatar. diack has strongly denied the accusations against him, calling them “the biggest lie in the history of world sport.” his father, now 84, has been held under arrest in france since 2015.  failing to alert authorities to suspicious transactions can result in financial penalties for banks. in july, in a separate case, french banking regulators fined société générale nearly $6 million for inadequate anti-money laundering controls.

       " \"william g. douglas, a longtime reporter covering washington politics for the mcclatchy news service and the co-host of its majority minority  podcast , somehow finds time in the 24-hour news cycle to write regularly about diversity in hockey in his popular blog,  the color of hockey .  mr. douglas fell for the game at an early age while growing up in philadelphia. when the united states men’s hockey team plays its first game at the pyeongchang olympics, on wednesday against slovenia, mr. douglas will be there, keeping a close eye on jordan greenway, the first african-american to play for the team.  tell us more about your blog and how it came to be.  i started the color of hockey in december 2012. it was born of the stanley cup playoffs series in 2012 between the washington capitals and the boston bruins. in that series, the capitals forward joel ward, who now plays for the san jose sharks, scored the game 7 overtime goal that eliminated the bruins from the playoffs. the goal unleashed a torrent of racist social media posts aimed at ward, who is black, from so-called bruins fans. i had thought that we were beyond that in hockey, but i was wrong. so i decided to start the blog to help educate people — white and minority — that folks of color have a hockey history and a place in the game. i like to say that the color of hockey is about the history and growing impact of people of color in the game.  what’s your own playing history?  i’m a goaltender who still plays about once a week, or as my work/family schedule allows. i started playing when i was 12 or 13 years old, growing up in philadelphia. i was home sick watching t.v. and came across the 1972 summit series between team canada and the soviet union. i liked what i saw, but i really didn’t know what hockey was. so i looked it up in the encyclopedia. when i got well, i saved my allowance and bought a pair of skates. after i got proficient on blades, i saved more and bought goalie equipment. i taught myself to play the position, watching n.h.l. goalies on t.v. and reading jacques plante’s book on goaltending. i joined a bantam hockey team out of west philadelphia that played at the university of pennsylvania’s class of 1923 rink. i progressed and played one season of junior b-level hockey for a team that was called red lion and belonged to a league called the junior mid-atlantic league. we weren’t very good as a team, but i learned a lot about goaltending because i saw a ton of shots.        by day you’re a reporter and podcaster, how do you find the time to do all this?  that’s an interesting question. my 19-year-old twin daughters ask me when i sleep. i tell them “i don’t know.” i blog as time allows — at least once a week, usually writing posts on the weekend while watching hockey on t.v. and sometimes my political work and hockey merge. i occasionally play pickup hockey with capitol hill staffers and lobbyists. i used to play morning pickup with a group that included the then-sen. john kerry of massachusetts.  how has the game become more diverse, and where does it still need to go?  i think the face of hockey is changing for several reasons. in many ways it reflects the changing of north america through the growth of minority populations and immigration. karl subban, the father of the nashville predators defenseman p.k. subban, likes to tell the story about how he moved with his family from jamaica to sudbury, ontario, as a boy and how hockey helped him assimilate into the canadian fabric. i think increased affluence also has something to do with it. minority families are moving out of cities and into suburbs and their kids are playing what their new friends are playing. it may be hockey, or soccer, or lacrosse. as for urban kids whose families who can’t afford hockey, there are a growing number of programs that provide equipment, ice time and instruction at little or no costs. these include programs like philadelphia’s ed snider youth hockey foundation, new york’s ice hockey in harlem and washington’s fort dupont ice hockey club. fort dupont is the oldest minority-oriented youth hockey program in the united states.            image     jordan greenway is the first african-american to play for the united states men's hockey team.   credit  kiichiro sato/associated press         mr. greenway will make his debut wednesday. what should we know about him?  greenway is huge — 6-foot-5, 230 pounds — at 20 years old. he’s a dangerous combination of size, speed and finesse. he earned his way onto the u.s. roster from his performance at the 2017 international ice hockey federation world junior championship that was played in montreal and toronto. greenway was consistently one of the best players on the ice. a man among boys is a sports cliché, but with his size and scoring hands, he was indeed a man among boys. he should be in the n.h.l. sometime after he finishes at boston university. he’s a 2015 second-round draft pick of the minnesota wild. he has a younger brother, defenseman j.d. greenway, who plays for the university of wisconsin (coached by the u.s. olympic hockey coach tony granato) and was drafted by the toronto maple leafs in the third round of the 2016 n.h.l. draft.              who are some other players to watch at the olympics?  •  sarah nurse , a forward for canada’s women’s hockey team. a black canadian, she’s the cousin of darnell nurse, a defenseman with the n.h.l.’s edmonton oilers, and kia nurse, a point guard for the connecticut women’s basketball team. sarah nurse tallied 76 goals and 61 assists in 150 games for the university of wisconsin and could be one of canada’s key scoring weapons at the games.   • randi griffin , a forward on korea’s unified women’s hockey team. griffin, who is half-korean, is a north carolinian who played college hockey at harvard. like a couple of other north americans on the korean team, she was initially recruited by korean hockey officials via a blind email. she thought the email was a hoax and ignored it for months.   • brigette lacquette , a defenseman for canada’s women’s team. she’s cote first nation and has made it a mission to inspire first nations/native american youth with her play.  a lot has been made about n.h.l. players not being at these games. what do you think?  as a fan, i have mixed feelings about the n.h.l. not being in pyeongchang. it feels odd not having the best players in the world here. at the same time, the lack of n.h.l. starpower makes the men’s olympic hockey tournament a wild card that could be full of surprises.       \",\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the skier lindsey vonn, the last member of the american team to arrive in south korea for the winter olympics, insisted on friday that she would not be nervous before the three races she planned to enter in her fourth and likely final games.  “i’m just going to lay it all out there,” a smiling vonn, considered one of the greatest skiers of all time, said at a news conference.  the first american woman to win the olympic downhill, at the 2010 vancouver games, vonn missed the 2014 sochi olympics because of a knee injury.  “i was much healthier in 2010,” she said. “but in 2018, i’m much stronger mentally.”  in an emotional interlude during her news conference, vonn broke down in tears as she discussed her grandfather, don kildow, who recently died and to whom she has dedicated her races in pyeongchang.        “i want so badly to do well for him, and i miss him so much,” vonn said of her paternal grandfather, who died in november. “i wish he was here and able to watch me, but i know he’s watching. i’m going to win for him.”  vonn’s first race, the women’s super-g, will not be for eight days, but vonn wanted to arrive in time for the opening ceremony, something she has not done since her first olympics in 2002 in salt lake city.  in every recent olympics, vonn’s best event, the women’s downhill, has been contested near the first weekend of competition, too close to the opening ceremony to allow for rest and preparation. this year, the women’s downhill is not until feb. 21. vonn said that this time she is trying “to soak in as much of the olympic experience as i can.”  vonn, 33, enters the games on a winning streak having finished first in her last two world cup races. she plans to enter the alpine combined as her final event feb. 23.        “i’m very happy with my skiing right now,” vonn said. “last weekend was just the icing on the cake.”  vonn also looked past the 2018 pyeongchang games, vowing to continue to race on the world cup until she breaks the record of 86 world cup wins held by ingemar stenmark. vonn has won 81 world cup races.  “i think next year i can get beyond that,” she said of stenmark’s record.  vonn competed for attention at the news conference with her dog, lucy, which she often travels with and brought to the news conference.  “she’s always with me,” vonn said. “so i figured i’d need her for the most important event.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — to say the winter olympics are not racially diverse is like noting the weather in pyeongchang is cold. this is not surprising.  the winter games have deep scandinavian roots, and draw athletes from the colder, predominantly white — and often wealthy — regions of the united states, germany and austria.  but looking across social media as the games pick up, some of the biggest stars have been an unexpectedly diverse group.  with viral videos, trending topics and plenty of gifs, the internet has crowned some of the early fan favorites as the american speedskater maame biney, the jamaican women’s bobsled team and, adding to momentum they built up long before the opening ceremony friday, the  nigerian women’s bobsled team  (not to mention the  shirtless tongan  competing improbably as a cross-country skier after flaming out in taekwondo at the 2016 summer olympics).        they are not necessarily medal contenders, nor underdogs. and their outsize presence on social media belies the reality on the ground here of an overwhelming white population of athletes.  the undeniable advantage in the winter games has long gone to nations with the strongest national governing bodies, which are the biggest financing system for athletes in training.  the jamaican bobsled athlete jazmine fenlator-victorian knows that advantage firsthand. a new jersey native, she was recruited by the united states to bobsledding as a 22-year-old and competed in the 2014 sochi olympics. yet fenlator-victorian, a dual citizen of the united states and jamaica, decided to represent jamaica in the pyeongchang games.  “it’s important to me that little girls and boys see someone that looks like them, talks like them, has the same culture as them, has crazy curly hair and wears it natural, has brown skin-included in different things in this world,” she said, fighting back tears.              image     the jamaican women’s bobsled team during the winter olympics opening ceremony. they have drawn many fans online.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “when you grow up and you don’t see that, you feel that you can’t do it and that is not right,” she said. “so coming back home to jamaica, i wanted my jamaican people to see that they can do it … if they want to be a winter olympian and do alpine ski, now they see their fellow jamaican in the winter olympics.”  nearly 3,000 athletes from 92 countries are competing in the pyeongchang olympics. six of those nations — ecuador, eritrea, kosovo, malaysia, nigeria and singapore — are competing in the winter olympics for the first time.  asia has also become a major force in the olympics movement as the host for the next two games after pyeongchang. the next summer olympics will be held in tokyo in 2020, and the next winter olympics will be held in beijing in 2022.  for its part, the united states olympic committee said that its team is the most diverse it has fielded at a winter olympics.  of the 243 athletes, 10 are african-american and 10 are asian-american. the u.s.o.c. does not release data on other racial and ethnic groups because the national governing bodies for individual sports collect and report the data and have done so inconsistently (the sports ask but do not require athletes to report their racial and ethnic identities).  jason thompson, the director of diversity and inclusion at the committee, said progress has been made in fielding a more diverse team, but that more needs to be done to recruit athletes across racial and ethnic groups.        “i think we’re not where we want to be,” he said, “but it’s a huge jump to show that winter sports are for everybody.”  the sports that have seen the biggest increase in racial diversity are those drawing so-called crossover athletes — those talented in one sport who adapt to a new one.              “sometimes it’s just that they haven’t been introduced to the sport,” thompson said. many bobsled athletes, for example, are former elite track sprinters.  this year’s delegation includes erin jackson, the first african-american woman to qualify for the united states long-track speedskating team, and jordan greenway,  the first black hockey player    on the    men’s team .  biney, an effervescent 17-year-old and the first african-american woman to compete for the united states in speedskating at the winter olympics, has quickly become a social media darling.  she was born in ghana and moved to the united states at the age of 5. she learned how to skate soon after, but her coach told her father she was too fast for figure skating. so she enrolled in speedskating.        “i think it hit, i think it finally hit,” biney said at the opening ceremony. “i’m actually here at the olympic games. holy cow. it’s awesome.”          on jan. 3, biney  tweeted her thanks  to “the real mvp,” shani davis, who is competing in his fifth olympics. in 2006, at the turin olympics, davis became the first african-american to win an individual gold medal at the winter games.  in her twitter post, biney said of davis: “you’ve inspired me and paved the way as the first african-american speed skater to make an olympic team.”  davis has been in conflict with the u.s.o.c. after it used a coin flip to decide which athlete out of two finalists would carry the american flag in the opening ceremony.            image        biney racing in the 500 meters on saturday. she is the first african-american woman to compete for the united states in speedskating at the olympics.   credit  bernat armangue/associated press         the committee, he said in a twitter post last week, “dishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer.”        “no problem,” he added. “i can wait until 2022. #blackhistorymonth2018 #pyeongchang2018”  davis has not commented since, and has made his  twitter account  private, leaving others to interpret what he meant by the black history month reference.  if biney is feeling the pressure of paving the way for the next generation of african-american women entering the sport, she is taking it with stride. she was full of laughter on saturday shortly after securing her spot in the final 16 in the 500 meters. “i’m just ready to get out there on tuesday and let it rip,” she said.  thirteen athletes from eight african nations will be competing in south korea, the largest representation of athletes from african nations in any winter games. there has yet to be a winter olympics medal awarded to any athlete representing an african nation.  the nigerian bobsled team has high, perhaps sky high, expectations to change that.  they make up the  first african nation  to compete in bobsled at the olympics, and, win or lose, they said that they hope to make a lasting impression.  “this could be something that would be really cool, something that we give back, something that people could just be proud of and we could be just kind of low key, get it done, and we could just live in that legacy,” seun adigun, the captain and driver of the team, said in pyeongchang. “or, people would get really, really excited, and then we’d have to figure out how to manage life that way.”  they already are celebrities in the athletes’ village.          yet they did not get to the games easily.  just the cost of equipment and travel can quickly overwhelm an athlete reaching for qualification. and for nations without olympic delegations, much of the work that normally falls on organizing bodies instead falls on the athletes.        nigeria had no bobsled federation until the women on the team created one.  adigun raised a total of $150,000 on  gofundme , a crowdsourcing website, to help fund her team’s training and gear.  the team is now featured in  beats by dre ads  and is a part of  team visa promotions .  they, along with the team from jamaica, will take their first olympic run on  feb. 20 .

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — five days after chicago lost the bid to host the 2016 summer olympics, finishing dead last in the voting, stephanie streeter stepped down from her role as the acting chief executive of the united states olympic committee. it showed that there was some accountability for an embarrassing failure and that someone needed to — and did — take the fall for a very public stumble.  in comparison, what do we have in light of the sexual abuse of 250-plus gymnasts at the hands of dr. lawrence g. nassar, a former member of the u.s.o.c.’s national medical network advisory board?  the opposite of accountability.  it’s the u.s.o.c. board members praising scott blackmun, the olympic committee’s chief executive, at a news conference in pyeongchang on friday for serving the organization “with distinction” and for doing “a phenomenal job,” even though the nassar scandal unfolded under his watch.  it’s larry probst, chairman of the committee’s board, apologizing to nassar’s victims but also saying, hey, the u.s.o.c. hasn’t come out of this scandal unscathed because “there has been a tremendous amount of criticism.”        probst said that blackmun would be keeping his job — for which he was paid $1 million in 2016 — until the u.s.o.c. has reason for him to leave. the organization has ordered an independent investigation of its actions in the nassar matter.  (blackmun is not in pyeongchang because he is recovering from surgery to treat prostate cancer).  it’s not enough that the u.s.o.c. was told by u.s.a. gymnastics in 2015, according to report in the wall street journal, that gymnasts had accused nassar of sexual misconduct and that the u.s.o.c. did nothing to intervene —  a fact highlighted by the wall street journal.   and it’s not enough that senators jeanne shaheen, democrat of new hampshire, and joni ernst, republican of iowa, called last week for blackmun’s removal. or that more and more calls for blackmun’s head are coming in by the day. those demands make complete sense when the u.s.o.c.’s weak oversight of olympic sports’ national governing bodies very likely helped a predator like nassar thrive.  on thursday, senator dianne feinstein, a california democrat who sponsored a bill that made it mandatory for olympic governing bodies to report sexual abuse to the police, also called for blackmun’s resignation.  “if mr. blackmun did nothing for a year after learning about the allegations of widespread sexual abuse, then he should step down,” ms. feinstein said, through a spokeswoman, in response to emailed questions. “there can be zero tolerance for turning a blind eye to sexual abuse of minors.”        both senators from colorado, senator michael bennet, a democrat, and senator cory gardner, a republican — said through their representatives that anyone who knew about the nassar accusations and did nothing must step down. the u.s.o.c. is based in colorado.  probst said on friday that blackmun had acted just as he was supposed to after learning of the accusations against nassar.  but the call for blackmun’s ouster shouldn’t be just about the u.s.o.c.’s role in the nassar matter. because it’s certainly not the only sexual abuse scandal that has unfolded under blackmun’s watch.  to his credit, blackmun spearheaded the efforts to create the denver-based u.s. center for safesport, a national nonprofit organization providing education and resources, including a hotline, to promote respect and prevent abuse in sport. it took seven years.  other sports, like swimming, taekwondo and judo, have had major abuse problems, and blackmun was introduced to some of them soon after he took over as chief executive in 2010. right away, he should have recognized that the u.s.o.c. needed to oversee the federations with a sharper eye and make it a priority to address abuse. he should have seen that it was the u.s.o.c.’s duty to keep all athletes safe.  in 2010, three months after blackmun was hired, u.s.a. swimming came under fire for mishandling dozens of sexual abuse cases. that year, the swimming organization set up a program to investigate sexual abuse accusations within its own sport. but letting a federation investigate itself is never a good idea, and the abuse continued.  in 2016, u.s.a. taekwondo told the u.s.o.c. that it had been investigating sexual assault accusations involving two of its biggest olympic stars. but after consulting with the u.s.o.c., the taekwondo federation  put the investigation on hold  for the rio olympics, and those athletes competed at the games, according to usa today.        at the rio olympics, blackmun addressed revelations in the indianapolis star that u.s.a. gymnastics had kept files of more than 50 complaints of sexual abuse of athletes, but failed to report them to law enforcement.  he called the u.s.o.c.’s policy regarding sexual abuse “state of the art,” even though the u.s. center for safesport — whose charge was to investigate sexual abuse and other misconduct cases — hadn’t yet opened.  “we became more focused on this issue in 2010,” blackmun said.  the safesport center started fielding calls in 2017. that’s seven years of abuse cases in olympic sports, and seven years of the u.s.o.c. letting national federations investigate their own abuse cases.  that slow pace is a slap in the face to athletes. it showed that blackmun’s priority wasn’t to protect athletes. it took 200-plus abuse cases of girls and women in gymnastics for him to finally open his eyes.  blackmun and the u.s.o.c. couldn’t have missed the glaring fact that national federations shouldn’t be left to investigate themselves, no matter the issue. the federations’ goal is to market and promote their sports, so they can’t be trusted. it’s why the united states anti-doping agency was formed to handle drug testing and drug cases. when the federations were in charge of policing themselves, athletes often seemed to get away with cheating.  yet blackmun is more than hanging on: the u.s.o.c. is applauding him. what message does that send to the hundreds of athletes who have been abused since he took over as chief executive?  a terrible one.  so when considering whether blackmun should stay or go, remember what he said in rio regarding that initial report of abuse in gymnastics:  “we have to think, first and foremost, of the athlete.”       ',\n",
       " 'kitchener, ontario — andrew flemming and geoff fowler tinkered for months in their spare time. they used soldering irons. they printed three-dimensional models in their basements. they brainstormed over beers in this small city about 60 miles west of toronto, where they kept their project quiet.  “we did a fair bit of work in bars,” flemming said.  flemming and fowler, both 29, along with their friend and business partner, will hamilton, 37, were pouring their creative energies into a high-tech training device the likes of which the sporting world had never seen.  they were building a better broom.  not just any broom, but one that they thought could be essential to the sport of curling, which relies on the best broom handling out there as teams strategically cajole a polished granite rock across a sheet of ice.  they wound up calling it the smartbroom, and in a sport that can come across as vaguely primordial, their piece of 21st-century gadgetry could play a role in determining who wins gold at the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea.        matt hamilton, a member of the united states men’s team, overhauled his sweeping technique after training with a smartbroom. curlers from countries as far afield as china, denmark and switzerland have leaned on it in their preparation for the olympics. in all, will hamilton, who is not related to matt hamilton, said he had sold smartbrooms to eight of the 13 national curling federations sending teams to pyeongchang.            image     old prototype parts of the smartbroom are set up in engineer and smartbroom co-inventor andrew flemming’s home workshop.   credit  ian willms for the new york times         “we definitely learned a few tricks,” said marc kennedy, a member of the canadian men’s team.  a quick primer on sweeping: it is important. the science behind it is much more complicated than people think. the simplified version is that sweeping slightly increases the temperature of the ice while creating micro-scratches on the surface. the result is that players are better able to control for distance and trajectory as the rock travels down the sheet. the sport hinges on precision, so every brush stroke counts.  but for decades, there have been competing theories about sweeping. one such debate: is it more important to sweep faster, with a higher stroke rate, or harder, with greater force applied to the ice? and what about body positioning? do sweepers generate more power by holding the broom upright or at an angle?  these were the types of questions eating at will hamilton.  hamilton was coaching a junior women’s team six years ago and wanted to help his sweepers improve their technique. but he knew there was no clear way to assess how well they were actually doing. it was all guesswork.        hamilton dreamed of producing data that could be used to solve some of those age-old curling debates. so he zeroed in on flemming and fowler, two friends with engineering degrees. hamilton knew they liked to build stuff for fun. at the time, they were trying to invent a climate-controlled, water-cooled suit jacket.  when hamilton met with flemming over beers one night, he pitched a new project: was there a way to take a pedometer (to measure stroke rate) and a miniature bathroom scale (to measure force) and fuse them to a curling broom?  “so andrew looks at me like i’m an idiot and says, ‘no, you’d use, like, four sensors and an accelerometer,’ ” hamilton recalled. “but i could tell that he thought it was interesting.”            image        each smartbroom has four sensors in the broom head that relay data to a small display unit showing force in pounds and stroke rate in hertz.   credit  ian willms for the new york times         flemming and fowler were coming to realize that their climate-controlled suit jacket was not about to set the world on fire. (fowler still has a couple of half-finished prototypes in his closet.) perhaps they would be better served by focusing on the high-tech broom.  “this has been slightly more successful,” flemming said.  on a recent afternoon, flemming joined fowler and hamilton on the curling ice here at westmount golf and country club for a demonstration. they wore matching windbreakers with “smartbroom: sweep better” on the backs.  each smartbroom has four sensors in the broom head that relay data to a small display unit. hamilton took one for a spin down the ice, and the data was instantaneous — line graphs along with a slew of numbers that showed his force in pounds and his stroke rate in hertz. hamilton also pointed to a figure that he described as his “sweeping performance index,” or s.p.i., a metric that combines power and speed in one easy-to-digest figure.        patrick janssen, a world-class curler from canada, has consistently registered an s.p.i. in the 2,800 range. fowler provided context.  “as a thursday night club curler, i’d be happy to get 2,000,” he said.  the numbers by themselves might not mean much, flemming said, but subtle changes in technique can lead to big differences in the quality of each stroke. and now curlers have that information at their disposal. they can experiment to see which stroke works best for them.  “it’s sometimes tough to convince an athlete that what they’re doing is maybe not the best, because they feel like they’re working really, really hard,” flemming said. “and it’s probably true that they’re working really, really hard. but they might also be wasting a lot of energy.”              the first smartbroom was used by canada before the 2014 winter olympics in sochi, russia. but at the request of curling canada, the country’s national curling federation, hamilton and his partners agreed not to sell smartbrooms to other consumers until after the olympics. fowler called it a “polite agreement” rooted in relationships with curling canada officials.  in sochi, the canadian men and women swept gold.  ahead of the olympics in pyeongchang, the gospel of the smartbroom spread across the globe, and many of the teams competing in south korea this month are acolytes.  matt hamilton, the american curler, said he discovered that he was able to generate greater force by holding the broom more upright. kennedy, the canadian curler, said he learned that pressure was more important than stroke rate. so now he sacrifices speed for the sake of power.        “for years,” he said, “we thought it was the other way around.”  curlers have also used the smartbroom to assess their physical conditioning. they can compare their statistics from the beginning of a workout to those at the end, or even after several weeks of training.  will hamilton declined to say how many smartbrooms he and his partners have sold, but they are not retiring anytime soon — or even quitting their day jobs. flemming and fowler are engineers, and hamilton works in information technology for a hardware company. the smartbroom, hamilton said, is a “side hustle,” albeit a useful one. the broom retails for $3,000. (canadians get a discount.)  they all hope that more innovations are forthcoming. for example: hardware light enough to embed in brooms used in competition so that real-time statistics can be broadcast on television.  “this,” flemming said, “is not the end of what we plan to do.”       ',\n",
       " 'san jose, calif. — top officials with the united states figure skating association said on wednesday that they would welcome north korea’s participation in the winter olympics next month in south korea, setting up a potential conflict with the white house.  “we’re hoping they’re there,” david raith, executive director of u.s. figure skating, said of north korea,  which has qualified a pairs skating team for the games  and whose leader, kim jong-un, has signaled interest in participating. “it would be the safest place in the world.”  the trump administration has been more equivocal. asked at a news briefing on tuesday whether the united states supported participation by north korean athletes in the 2018 olympics, sarah huckabee sanders, the white house press secretary, said, “we haven’t made a final determination on that front.”  samuel auxier, the president of u.s. figure skating, speaking here at the united states championships, which will determine the olympic team, also raised the prospect that skaters might defy a call for a boycott of the games if one came from president trump.        the president has not said anything publicly about a potential boycott. and after  some ambiguous remarks last month by nikki haley , the american envoy to the united nations,  she tweeted  that “the u.s. looks forward to participating in the winter olympics,” which begin feb. 9 in pyeongchang, south korea, about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that divides the korean peninsula.  the possibility of a boycott surfaced again on monday when senator lindsey graham, republican of south carolina,  wrote on twitter  that the united states should avoid the games if north korea participates.  “allowing kim jong un’s north korea to participate in #winterolympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,” senator graham tweeted, referring to the north korean leader.          the tweet came even as south korea and north korea  were taking steps to open a dialogue .  mr. auxier chided mr. graham on wednesday at a news conference, saying of political leaders: “i think they need to be careful saying things like that, because these athletes have worked so hard to get there. the olympics should be above politics. they shouldn’t be playing politics with this.”        the united states’ boycott of the 1980 summer olympics in moscow, in retaliation for the soviet union’s invasion of afghanistan, was a “disaster” for many of the athletes who were not allowed to compete, mr. auxier said.  “i’d hate to see that,” he said of another boycott, “just because trump and kim jong-un are trying to see which button is bigger,” a reference  to mr. trump’s tweet  about comparing the size of the american and north korean nuclear buttons.  if there were “some type of war action, that would change things dramatically,” mr. auxier said. otherwise, he said, “i don’t think our athletes would boycott if they’ve been working all their lives for this. who knows what trump will tweet out. but if he were to say to boycott it, unless there was a very clear reason why to do it, i don’t think our athletes would boycott it. they want to compete.”  the ultimate decision on whether to participate in the games, mr. auxier said, would rest with the united states olympic committee, a private, nonprofit organization. that stance is widely shared by american officials in olympic-related sports, but it remains an open question whether president trump could prevent the united states from competing in the 2018 games.  scott blackmun, chief executive of the u.s.o.c., told reporters last month that he would leave the legalities to constitutional lawyers but stressed that the olympic committee was “100 percent committed” to sending athletes to the games unless it was “physically impossible or legally impossible.”  mark jones, a spokesman for the u.s. olympic committee, reiterated that position on wednesday night, saying in a telephone interview, “we intend to bring a full delegation to the olympic games and paralympic games.”  in his annual new year’s day speech, mr. kim said that he was open to the idea of sending an official delegation and athletes to the games.        south korea’s president, moon jae-in, and the international olympic committee have sought north korea’s participation in the 2018 games for months as a way to reduce military and nuclear tensions on the peninsula.  north korea agreed on wednesday  to reopen a hotline between the two countries , and mr. moon has proposed a meeting of high-level negotiators there next week.

       " 'stamford, conn. — the olympic games may be taking place half a world away in south korea, but the heart of nbc’s broadcast operation is a sleepy city 35 miles northeast of new york.  near midnight here last thursday night, instead of leaving work, employees were shuttling in from local hotels, and the control rooms, production booths and editing bays were filled with hundreds of employees.  here in stamford, teams are filling nbc sports network and the olympic channel with 24/7 coverage of the pyeongchang games, and televising curling and hockey on cnbc and usa network. they are pushing out live streams of each sport, more than 1,800 hours over all, to laptops, phones and connected tvs, producing highlights and 4k video to feed to directv and dish customers.  the one thing not controlled from stamford: the 176 hours of coverage on the main nbc network, which is produced in pyeongchang and distributed out of its manhattan headquarters in rockefeller center.        nbcuniversal, a subsidiary of comcast, has paid $10 billion to broadcast the games through 2032, making the company by far the largest media player in the olympics universe. the exclusive united states broadcast rights ensure that nbc’s channels dominate the ratings for a couple of weeks every two years and serve as a monthlong platform to promote other programming, though the network does not always reap a profit. nbc lost $223 million on the 2010 winter games in vancouver.  nbc’s prime-time ratings are down 16 percent from the sochi games four years ago, though that has been countered by nbcsn’s most-watched week ever. here in stamford, the hundreds of employees working on the pyeongchang games are too busy putting out most of nbcuniversal’s 2,400 hours of live coverage over 19 days to dwell on the ratings.  nbc rented out 600 rooms at area hotels, so employees don’t have to return home at night.  “my shift right now is basically 3 in the afternoon to 9 in the morning,” said dean walker, a coordinating producer who normally works out of nbc’s facilities in dry creek, colo. marc buono, a digital video manager, joked that “you have to time your final cup of coffee,” or risk missing a precious hour or two of sleep.            image     monitoring curling matches — part of the 2,400 hours of live coverage by nbcuniversal over 19 days of the pyeongchang games.   credit  jeenah moon for the new york times         days blend into night, and employees lose most sense of time; there are signs reminding everybody which day of the olympics it is. ahead of the games, many shifted their sleeping schedules to match pyeongchang — 14 hours ahead of the east coast — and wake up around 5 p.m. here.        if they can hold on for “breakfast” long enough, the on-site commissary is known to serve tasty omelets after midnight.  on an ordinary day, when the olympics are not happening, about 750 people work out of the facility, a gleaming 300,000-square-foot structure that formerly was a clairol factory. nbc sports took it over in 2012. the facility was designed specifically to handle the load of an olympics, and during the games the number of workers swells to about 1,300, in addition to the 2,000 nbc staff members in south korea.  the stamford crew passes the hours monitoring dozens of video and audio feeds that zip across the pacific ocean from south korea on one of four fiber-optic lines before spider-webbing their way across the united states. the journey takes just milliseconds.  the broadcast operations center also receives satellite feeds from south korea, a fail-safe to ensure the games stay on-air no matter what happens. these feeds take a comparatively sluggish two seconds to reach stamford. “it’s a speed-of-light problem,” said tim canary, the vice president of engineering.  as it has for past olympics, nbc is calling much of the action stateside in an effort to save money. this takes place in studio 4, usually used for storage but now filled with eight portable black booths, each about the size of a small bedroom. on one side of each occupied booth are two producers; on the other are two announcers calling an event “live” while watching monitors.  last thursday, the 2006 bronze medalist pete fenson, a curling analyst, was commentating on a match from one of the booths. events can even be called by announcers in both south korea and stamford, through a process called “collaborative off-tube.”        from prime time to morning, nbcsn shows the olympics live. during the day in the united states, and the korean night, it shows replays or events that were not shown live. for one hour each night, the figure skating preview show “olympic ice” is directed from an auxiliary control room, so workers can clean the main control room, which is in use the 23 other hours of the day.            image        when it’s daytime at the pyeongchang games, it’s nighttime in connecticut. the next two olympics are also in asia — tokyo in 2020 and beijing in 2022.   credit  jeenah moon for the new york times         if the “olympic ice” set looks familiar, that’s because it is the one used for “ football night in america ,” with small modifications. there’s an extra desk, and the red and yellow lights of “football night in america” have become the cool blues and purples of the pyeongchang games.  there are also 20 or so operations staffers mostly monitoring digital streams. as more americans move away from consuming sports on traditional televisions, the streaming operation has become vital.  just seven days into the pyeongchang games, the number of streamed minutes was poised to double the 420 million from sochi four years ago. nbc has since announced that pyeongchang streaming has tripled the sochi numbers. at the lowest point, usually 4 a.m. to 5 a.m. eastern, the streaming levels are the same as nbc sees for a decent english premier league game, while at the end of the workday they match those for “sunday night football.”  “you just lose track of time because the audience is so high,” said eric black, the digital chief technology officer.  that is doubly true for those in the highlights factory, a large room full of interns sitting at rows of computers, each decorated with a different country’s flag. eagle-eyed, the interns each watch a feed in search of something that would make a great highlight.  “the job is to not miss either of those things, especially those hiding in plain sight,” said eric hamilton, the digital video director in charge of the highlights factory.        the work can be tedious, but gems emerge.  after mikaela shiffrin won gold in the giant slalom, the highlights factory went back and put together a  video of shiffrin riding the chairlift  to the event and preparing for her run. that video did not immediately air on nbc because other skiers were still racing.  other times, the job is more straightforward. a highlight of shaun white’s gold medal run in the halfpipe has already been viewed 18 million times.

       " 'paris — on a warm and sunny day at the french open, tony estanguet was shivering.  losing an olympic bid at the wire is a traumatic experience, and estanguet was part of the paris delegation in singapore in july 2005 when paris was beaten by only four votes by london on the final ballot for the 2012 summer games.  “when we entered into the room for the final result, we were quite confident, and then it was, waaaah, cold shower,” estanguet said, shivering at the memory on monday during lunch at roland garros stadium with a small group of reporters.  for a city long accustomed to being admired by foreigners, paris has experienced a humiliating series of cold showers and shoulders from the international olympic committee. estanguet was also part of an earlier paris bid, in 2001, that lost out to beijing for the 2008 games.  but a dry and happy ending seems inevitable this time, even if estanguet, now the co-president of the paris bid for the 2024 olympics, was essentially bending over backward in his straight-back chair on monday to avoid sounding triumphant in its contest with a rival campaign from los angeles.        “i heard and learned a lot from the previous bids that anything can happen in the last minute,” he said. “we are still two candidates; there are still the same rules, so don’t count on me to be relaxed. i haven’t seen any paper that will tell me that i will get the games in paris in ’24, so i want to remain focused on this objective.”  but surely not even paris can flub this one. not with the i.o.c. executive board set to decide on friday in switzerland whether it will make an exception and allow the i.o.c. members to select the 2024 and 2028 host cities at the same time. not with los angeles, the only other bidder, dropping hints that it could be persuaded to accept i.o.c. concessions in exchange for waiting four more years for 2028.  could the i.o.c. really jilt paris again? or even make it settle for second dibs after a bid from a country whose new president is hardly winning any international popularity contests?            image     tony estanguet, who is leading paris’s 2024 olympic bid, taking a selfie with the bidding team.   credit  franck fife/agence france-presse — getty images         estanguet was not taking that bait, either. in the wake of president trump’s decision last week to withdraw the united states from the 2015 paris climate accord, estanguet was asked by a reporter, who did not expressly mention trump, if a country with what he labeled blatant disregard for the environment should be allowed to host the olympic games.        “i see your question,” estanguet said, which really meant, “i see your trap.”  “i don’t want to comment anything about trump,” estanguet said. “what i can tell you is that i think the i.o.c. needs to get a sustainable games at the moment. this is really important. personally, i think that’s part of the credibility of the whole system, and not only during the games time.”  the los angeles bid is, of course, making big commitments of its own to sustainability, and the truth is that the i.o.c., which has gotten so much wrong in recent years, is lucky — very lucky — to have two bids of this quality.  now it appears the i.o.c. will find a way to avoid choosing at all. this kind of goal-post shifting in a bidding process is far from ideal. imagine how many other candidates might have thrown their hats into the rings if it had been clear from the start that the i.o.c. was going to award 2024 and 2028 simultaneously?  but at this existential moment for the i.o.c. — with cities and citizenries questioning the value of the olympic project — it looks to be the right call to go with two close-to-sure things and regroup.  estanguet and paris continue to insist in public that they are interested only in 2024, but estanguet also made it clear on monday — 100 days before the scheduled i.o.c. vote in lima, peru — that he has no problem with the dual-award concept.  “there is no doubt it makes sense at the moment for the i.o.c. to look at this situation and see if it’s possible to have a double award,” he said. “but at the same time, we remain on the same line. we keep on pushing the same line, saying our project has been built for ’24.”        this is clever campaigning. paris, according to estanguet, has “95 percent” of its olympic venues already built, lacking only the aquatics center and the olympic village. he said that the land for the athletes’ village has been set aside only until the vote in lima in september. but if paris were offered 2028 and only 2028, one suspects that its mayor, anne hidalgo, and the new french president, emmanuel macron, would find a way to make it all work.  paris has been waiting much longer than los angeles, which last staged the olympics in 1984. paris hosted the games in 1900 and 1924, which would make 2024 a centennial celebration, even if that is hardly a persuasive argument on its own.  the plan is for roland garros to stage both tennis and boxing in 2024, with the boxing under a temporary, or perhaps even permanent, roof in suzanne lenglen court, the second biggest arena in the complex. there has been boxing at roland garros before; the french star marcel cerdan defeated the american holman williams there in a makeshift ring in 1946.  but the tournament site, built in 1928, has never been an olympic venue. “it’s important to our bid because it’s a well-recognized place internationally,” estanguet said.  familiar backdrops are a big part of the paris bid’s appeal: beach volleyball on the champ-de-mars below the eiffel tower; equestrian events at the château de versailles; fencing and taekwondo in the grand palais.  london had similarly iconic tools, but it also had a better, sexier plan than paris for 2012. chastened and curious, estanguet, a three-time olympic champion in white-water canoeing, paid a visit with a paris delegation to london in 2013 to meet with the chairman of those olympics, sebastian coe, and his team.  it was part of the process of learning from past mistakes. estanguet said that insiders have told him that paris’s 2012 bid had too many politicians in the forefront and not enough athletes, and that the bid was also too inwardly focused on france rather than the issues facing the olympic movement as a whole.        just 39, estanguet, the same age as macron, is part of the new french look, and if paris does secure the 2024 games, it already has been announced that he will be the head of the organizing committee.  despite past shivers, he had best get ready.

       " 'montreal — the world anti-doping association’s compliance review committee will meet in montreal, the organization’s home city, on monday and tuesday to discuss a problem that will not go away — russia’s antidoping laboratories, and what to do about the country missing a key end-of-year deadline.  no matter what the committee recommends, and the possibilities range from competition bans to mere slaps on the wrist to nothing, the long-running story of russia’s antidoping laboratories is bound to continue.  hanging in the balance is the credibility of the world’s foremost antidoping watchdog, which has endured withering criticism from athletes in recent months who say the organization has allowed a rogue nation to run roughshod over its attempts at enforcement.  in an open letter last week to jonathan taylor, the chairman of the compliance review committee, the swedish biathlete sebastian samuelsson wrote, “given that this doping crisis involving russia is the biggest in history, and the fact that many athletes have so shamefully been cheated out of podium positions not to mention financial rewards by the state-sponsored doping system, this issue requires proper leadership and good, honest communication — two things that have been very neglected by the current wada leadership.”        wada leaders have said they remain committed to clean sport and holding russia to account.  roughly four years after russia’s corruption of the drug-testing process first came to light, wada’s executive committee voted 9 to 2 in september to allow  russia to resume testing its own athletes  for performance-enhancing drugs, even though it had not fulfilled every requirement of a compliance agreement.  russia’s drug-testing agency had been banned since 2015, after a vast state-sponsored doping scheme was uncovered. while 160 russian athletes were cleared to compete in the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, they competed under the banner of olympic athletes from russia, and russia remains a controversial member of the international sports world. in 2016, russian athletes had to receive special permission from the international federations governing their sports to compete at the rio games.  individual federations have handled the situation differently. some, like the international association of athletics federations, which oversees track and field, have barred all russian athletes from competing since 2015. others, like soccer’s governing body, fifa, have  allowed them to compete .  the reinstatement of the russian anti-doping agency’s laboratories came with a number of conditions attached, all of which russia agreed to. the most significant condition compelled russia to hand over data from its corrupted antidoping laboratories by the end of the year. numerous wada teams sent to russia were rebuffed, and russia  missed the deadline .  last week, a three-person wada team in moscow was finally  allowed into the laboratory to begin collecting data . the computer data sought by wada investigators had been sealed off by russian law enforcement, leading to the bizarre circumstance of the russian anti-doping agency urging the russian government to cooperate with wada on an investigation of the russian anti-doping agency’s own laboratories.        it was unclear whether the work would be completed before the compliance review committee began meeting at wada’s headquarters on monday, or if russian law enforcement would impose any more hurdles. but even if the work is completed, it is highly unlikely that wada officials will quickly be able to certify that the data is complete and authentic, and some skeptics will not trust the data no matter what because russia missed the deadline.            image     sebastian samuelsson of sweden has become an outspoken critic of wada.   credit  robert michael/agence france-presse — getty images         “on monday, i will be asking, ‘have we got the data?’ and if the answer is no, it will be a short discussion,” said taylor, a lawyer based in london. his implication was that if the data was incomplete, the committee would have no choice but to recommend russia be declared noncompliant.  if that happens, the future participation of russian athletes in international competitions will once again be in doubt, a situation that major sports organizations like the international olympic committee are desperate to avoid.  a number of sporting figures have called for russia to be declared noncompliant for missing the deadline. most prominently, wada’s own athlete committee  has said  it expects russia to be declared noncompliant, and that anything less “will be considered a failure by wada to act on behalf of clean athletes.”  travis tygart, the head of the united states anti-doping agency and a vocal critic of how wada has handled russia, sounded a cautious note on friday.  “of course, if accurate, it is a good thing that the signals emerging from wada are that its group has been allowed into the moscow laboratory,” he said in a statement. but in the meantime, he believes russia should be declared noncompliant.        even if wada obtains all the data, managing the process remains complicated. “the question will be how do we move forward, what do we do about the fact that they are late, what do we do about the fact that we don’t know yet that the data are authentic,” taylor said.  the committee will make a recommendation and send it to wada’s executive committee, which is expected to meet later in january.  the executive committee, which generally follows the recommendations of the compliance review committee, can choose to do nothing, and allow russia’s reinstatement to remain. if it decides to once again seek the suspension of russia’s antidoping laboratories, it will send a letter asserting noncompliance laying out a set of recommended consequences. russia would then have 21 days to decide whether to agree, or to challenge the noncompliance in front of the court of arbitration for sport.  if wada declines to seek noncompliance, the next deadline is june 30. by then, russia must submit any stored athlete samples that, based on the data, wada wishes to examine.  the data wada seeks consists of about 10,000 suspicious doping samples. assuming wada finds that a number of them contain evidence of doping, it will be up to the dozens of individual sports federations to bring cases and charge the athletes.  in other words, whether russia is declared noncompliant or not, the continuing fallout from the country’s doping scheme is likely to stretch deep into 2019, especially with the world track and field championships set for september in doha, qatar.

       " 'when christine girard was presented with the gold medal in weight lifting from the 2012 olympics, there was a podium, a canadian flag and an anthem sung by a choir. in the audience were olympians, officials, friends and family.  included among them were her three children, none of them yet born in 2012. that’s because the presentation of the medal came on monday, more than six years after the competition.  in london, girard lifted a total of 520 pounds, good for third place in her division. it was the first medal ever for a female canadian weight lifter. but in 2016, maiya maneza of kazakhstan and svetlana tsarukayeva of russia were disqualified after retesting of their samples revealed performance-enhancing drugs. girard became the retroactive gold medalist.  at the national arts center in ottawa, about 100 people gathered for a 20-minute ceremony during which girard finally got her gold medal.        “it was a win of our values, a win for clean sport,” girard said.  the increasing number of medal-winning athletes caught by testing years later, especially from the 2008 and 2012 games, has meant more and more athletes are receiving medals that for years they thought they had lost.            image     girard competing in the weight lifting event held at the 2008 olympics.   credit  ezra shaw/getty images         not all of them had elaborate ceremonies. adam nelson, the american shot-putter elevated to gold for the 2004 games, was  handed his medal o utside a burger king at the atlanta airport in 2013.  “anything they could do to recognize the athletes that were robbed of the moment would certainly go a long way toward repairing some of the damage that was done,” nelson  told usa today .  girard said: “i think it’s really important to have a big ceremony. the more we talk about the positive, the better it could be for future athletes.”        even when girard was competing, the specter of drugs hung over the competition. “unfortunately, my sport has a strong correlation between the results and taking drugs,” she said. of her competitors at the time, she said, “we had a lot of suspicion, but we had no proof.”  girard returned her 2012 bronze medal last spring. but the gold she was awarded on monday was not the one that maneza was given. “they made new medals or they took some from the museum,” girard said.  girard also received a bronze from the 2008 games in beijing, where she originally finished fourth.  besides her motherhood duties, the now-retired girard is planning to return to college for a master’s in occupational therapy.  she is bullish on the future for clean weight lifters.  “i wanted to prove that it was possible to beat them,” she said of drug users, “and stay true to who we are. i remember the first time i beat someone who got caught. i said, ‘see, see, i can do this.’”       ',\n",
       " 'duluth, minn. — the night he won gold at the winter olympics in february, tyler george slept with the medal next to his pillow. he wanted to make sure it would still be there in the morning.  nearly a year later, he still has barely let the medal out of sight, in large part because he has not been allowed to let it out of sight.  “i know that if i show up without that thing, they’ll send me home,” george said.  this is what happens when you are part of the first american men’s curling team to win an olympic gold medal.  as invited guests at hockey games, golf tournaments and parades across the country, the members of the team have found that just about everyone wants a look at those medals. george and his four teammates — john shuster, john landsteiner, matt hamilton and joe polo — have appeared at award shows, state fairs, countless learn-to-curl events and  at least one broadway production  (“the play that goes wrong”). they have given pep talks to marathoners and delivered commencement speeches to high school students. they have sung karaoke with jimmy fallon and  blown the gjallarhorn  at a minnesota vikings game.        their medals have been kissed by dozens, caressed by hundreds and worn by thousands — literally thousands, they say. and forget about all the selfies. between stops, the members of the team have gone so far as to bathe the faded ribbons from which the medals dangle.  “but it doesn’t bring that blue back,” shuster, 36, said with a trace of resignation.  they did not expect their victory tour to last quite so long, not that they are complaining. but there was something charming and inspiring about their olympic experience, which they capped with victories against canada and sweden to clinch the united states’ first gold in curling, the ice sport played with brooms and smooth granite rocks.  and so the invitations keep coming — as long as they remember to bring their medals with them.            image     tyler george during the gold medal game against sweden.   credit  doug mills/the new york times             image        the american men had never won gold in curling.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “i had a feeling that it would be crazy,” george said, “but it’s so far beyond what any of us could have imagined.”        how crazy?  hamilton’s distinctive bushy mustache was endorsed by remington after the olympics.  “i’m on a box, which is pretty neat,” he said.  hamilton, 26, said he believed the team’s everyman nature was a factor in its appeal. as he put it, “we’re not these  chiseled gods .”  landsteiner, 28, wonders if their medals have been the most widely traveled and heavily handled of any from the pyeongchang games. among the luminaries who have tried them on:  aaron rodgers , the quarterback of the green bay packers;  nick faldo , the three-time masters winner; and  alfonso ribeiro , the actor best known for his role as carlton banks on “the fresh prince of bel-air.”  the team became a big story at the olympics after it bounced back from a slow start to defeat a series of curling behemoths in the medal round. by the time the team  staged its upset for gold , it was the middle of the night back home in minnesota, where george grew up learning the game at the  duluth curling club .  sammy perrella, a longtime friend and the proprietor of sammy’s pizza, watched the final on television with friends — “and i was driving that night, so i was on my best behavior,” he said — before he migrated to george’s parents’ house, which became party central after someone made a celebratory pit stop at the liquor store that tyler runs with his father, tom.  “all of a sudden about 30 people show up with all this booze,” perrella said. “it went until like 10 in the morning. i was wrecked for two days!”            image        u.s. olympic gold medalists in curling john landsteiner, matt hamilton, joe polo and tyler george, left to right, demonstrate their sport on the floor of the new york stock exchange.   credit  richard drew/associated press         back in south korea, george and his teammates got an immediate sense that their lives had changed forever when rick patzke, the chief executive of u.s.a. curling, handed them his cellphone as they were leaving the venue: it was dave grohl, the lead singer of the foo fighters, who had reached out through a mutual connection to offer his congratulations.        “i remember thinking, ‘really? is this how it’s going to be?’” patzke said.  in a word: yes.  after the olympics, the team members made the difficult decision to pass on an opportunity to defend their national championship at a tournament in north dakota. they went to new york instead, where they appeared on “the tonight show” and rang the opening bell at the new york stock exchange.  “we looked around, like, ‘well, we could be in fargo right now,’” george said.  at the  minnesota twins’ home opener in april , each member of the team threw out a ceremonial first pitch. hamilton rolled his toward home plate, as if he were curling. george, a former all-conference pitcher in high school, decided to test out the old wing and uncorked a wild throw that whizzed past the catcher.  “knew i was in trouble as soon as i released it,” george said. “damn near killed that guy.”            image        george, center, during a rare visit home at the duluth curling club. he jokes that his apartment is merely a storage facility where he occasionally sleeps.   credit  tim gruber for the new york times         he got a redo a few weeks later when the omaha storm chasers, the triple-a affiliate of the kansas city royals, invited them to throw out another batch of first pitches.  “i think i bounced that one,” george said, “but at least i didn’t kill anybody.”  while golfing in the bmw charity pro-am in may, hamilton and shuster broke out their gold medals to use as ball markers before putts, though shuster was the only one who was heckled.  “awfully humble, aren’t we?” a woman shouted from the gallery.  but that sort of reaction has been the exception. through all their experiences — meeting jack nicklaus as special guests at a golf tournament in ohio, dropping pucks at n.h.l. games, riding on the curling float at the national cherry festival — the team members have found that their gold medals have a gravitational pull all their own.        “when you hand it to an adult for a couple seconds, they’re like a child again,” hamilton said. “they’re captivated by it.”  george said he enjoyed being able to share it with so many people, and in so many unconventional ways.  “it is the world’s greatest coaster,” he said.  george and his teammates often receive appearance fees — they need to make a living, after all — but hamilton said he thought their success at the olympics would have generated more revenue from mainstream sponsors. curling, however, remains a fringe sport in most of the united states, despite their best efforts. and the process of negotiating a movie deal — another big aspiration — has been fraught with challenges, though they are optimistic that their story could be coming (someday) to a big screen near you.  “it’s a learning process,” hamilton said. “we’ve tried to surround ourselves with people who know what they’re doing.”            image        a calendar from 2013 in tyler george’s apartment and a big head cutout of george at the duluth curling club.   credit  photographs by tim gruber for the new york times         george announced in may that he was stepping away from competition, citing fatigue. he actually had felt burned out a couple of years ago, he said, but the olympics were an unfulfilled goal. he now travels the globe as an ambassador for u.s.a. curling.  “we’ve never seen this type of enthusiasm from people who want to learn more about the sport,” he said. “it’s been amazing to see.”        chris plys replaced george on the team, which has resumed its competitive schedule in earnest. plys, who did not compete at the olympics, used to feel guilty when fans would congratulate him for winning gold, because he did not actually win anything. so he would correct them. but it got to be too much.  “i’ve stopped explaining to them that i wasn’t on the team,” plys said. “i’m like, ‘thanks! the olympic village was great! can’t eat any more bulgogi!’”  as for george, he does not spend much time in his apartment in duluth these days. he thinks of it as more of a storage facility where he occasionally sleeps when he is not on the road with his medal. he still has a cat calendar from 2013 up on the wall near his kitchen. a congratulatory letter from vice president mike pence sits atop a pile of mail.  on occasion, george thinks back to the night that changed his life: the team’s 10-7 victory over sweden at gangneung curling centre. during the match itself, george did not allow himself to entertain the dream of winning gold until it was practically assured.  “because it would have been too much pressure if we’d thought about what was ahead of us — the places we’d go and the people we’d meet,” he said. “none of us had any idea.”       ',\n",
       " 'some of the world’s top biathletes descended this weekend on utah for the first time in 17 years. the return for a world cup event comes as salt lake city promotes its bid to host the 2030 olympics.  for armin auchentaller, the italian national who began overseeing the united states women’s team last spring, the needs are more immediate. biathlon, which combines nordic skiing and target shooting, is the only winter olympic sport in which team usa has never won a medal.  auchentaller’s job is to change that. in a recent phone interview from utah, where the team was preparing for competitions at soldier hollow, auchentaller cited his experience coaching the swiss biathlon team, which, like the united states, is not considered at the pinnacle of the sport. he said it had helped him understand how to take a team from nowhere to a place where where landing on an olympic podium is possible, as the swiss did in 2014.  here are edited excerpts from the interview with auchentaller.     you want to put an american on an olympic podium. were you an olympian?          i was good skier and good biathlete, but not good enough. but i was coaching with switzerland from 2014 to 2018, and we had good results. i built up the team there, because there wasn’t really much of a women’s team when i arrived. but by the end, we were able to get some results in the top 10.     what is the most important factor in creating a successful team here?   it’s not the successful sport here that it is in the european countries. we have just a few athletes, but those athletes we have, they are so committed and they have great personalities. the important thing is to work with them and get them better every single day.     did the top biathletes here grow up with the sport?   many of them were college cross-country skiers, and after they received their degree, they switched. so it’s very challenging to learn to shoot, to learn the game — what they can do, what they cannot do during a competition.     you could train me forever, and i would never be able to dunk a basketball or hit a 90-mile-per-hour fastball. can you teach someone to be a great shot?    everybody should have a little bit of talent to start. but it’s important to remember some of the great champions were not great shooters when they were young. i am convinced i can teach you shooting.           what is the hardest thing about shooting?   the most tricky thing is not technical, it’s the mental part, the emotional part, especially when it comes down to hit the last chart [target]. even the best biathletes, they have the technical qualities and skills, but the last shot is the hardest.     what americans have the best chance to get to a podium?    sean doherty on the men’s side. for the women, it’s susan dunklee and clare egan.     what is the key to their progress?    the main thing is try to be as consistent as possible. if you have too many ups and downs, the chances may be not as high, but if you are consistent, at some point you will get there. remember, in our sport, you can be in the lead, and if you miss on the last chart, instead of being on the podium, you can be 30th.     do u.s. biathletes have enough support?   we need even more private sponsors for the athletes to be able to pay their flights and other costs. the u.s.o.c. is our biggest sponsor, and we do have two or three minor sponsors, but we need the big ones especially to be able to develop the young athletes.     guns are very controversial in the united states, but they are popular with a large segment of the population. is that an advantage?    i definitely see it as an advantage. in the u.s., it can seem like everyone has a gun. we should use this, the popularity of these sport guns.     how is the fan support in the united states?   i wish it would it would be more popular in the u.s. if people get to know this sport, i know it will be very popular.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — before meghan duggan’s head hit the pillow at 4:30 a.m. friday, roughly 12 hours after her united states women’s hockey team beat canada to break a 20-year drought, she tucked her gold medal under the covers right next to her.  “we did it,” she said to herself again and again as her eyes finally closed on a night to remember for both the united states team and women’s sports in america.  yes, the americans did it — they beat their rivals in the hardest of hard-fought finals. there may be little competition in women’s hockey outside the two final teams. but the americans’ story line is even richer than this thrilling victory that was the pinnacle of the pyeongchang olympics for the united states, which is in danger of finishing these games with its lowest medal count since 1998, back when the games didn’t include many of the extreme sports in which americans excel.  their victory meant so much more than just a puck flying into the net to end a tense shootout.  “we all knew that this game was much bigger than just a game,” duggan said. “it was on all of our minds going in.”        here’s why: last march, the players threatened to boycott the world championships because negotiations with u.s.a. hockey over equal pay and support hadn’t gone anywhere in more than a year. the women argued that they weren’t getting paid a living wage and that girls’ youth hockey was being overlooked by the federation, while money poured into the boys’ side of the game. the players also wanted policies for maternity leave and child care.  there was a standoff. the federation began hunting for replacement players for worlds. the national team players began calling those potential replacements, asking them to take their side for the good of the game’s future — for all the women and little girls who hoped to be treated equally in the future.  a lot was at stake. the world championships were being held in michigan. an american boycott would have been a huge embarrassment. the players risked ruining their shot at these olympics, and derailing their careers. but their effort resonated outside the sport. billie jean king lent her support, and so did a group of united states senators. no matter the consequences, the hockey players wouldn’t — and didn’t — back down.  u.s.a. hockey was forced to give up, and it was a pivotal moment in the history of women’s sports.  “we bonded so much over it, and it brought us together,” duggan said on friday. “i don’t think we’d be here right now if we hadn’t stuck together.”  three days before the world championships last year, the players and the federation signed a new deal that provided athletes a salary of about $70,000 a year. that off-ice victory has given the players so many options now.        they don’t have to quit the sport because they can’t support themselves. before their new contract with u.s.a. hockey, players were paid $6,000 in an olympic year — and nothing in between olympic years. now the women don’t have to worry about their finances when making the decision of sticking with the game or not.            who won the most medals and more olympics questions, answered  the world’s best athletes schussed down the slopes, zoomed down the track and skated across the ice in south korea. here’s what you want to know about this year’s events.       jocelyne lamoureux-davidson, who scored the winning goal in the shootout, said she could now consider staying with the game because she still loved it and was still good at it.  “to have that choice, i think means the world to us,” she said.  to have a gold medal around their necks isn’t so bad either.  when lamoureux-davidson scored in the sixth round of a tiebreaking shootout, her shot resonated throughout the sport.  during thursday night’s celebration, duggan said she and her teammates watched video of the winning goal “a thousand times,” because as far as they were concerned, it was the most beautiful goal they’d ever seen in the history of hockey. with a couple of deft fakes and a whir of her stick, lamoureux-davidson sent the puck skittering past canada’s goalie, giving the united states the 3-2 victory and their first olympic gold medal since 1998.  “i feel like the gold medal adds more credibility to what we’re trying to do with women’s sports in our country,” forward hilary knight said. “i’m not saying our voice or our skills are any less if we didn’t win. i just think more people start paying attention, and we’re 100 percent trying to inspire the next generation.”        the team spent friday being interviewed by reporters from morning until evening, and they could barely stop to breathe.  duggan told me that this whole year has been “for women’s hockey in america,” and so much more.  “this is a moment for women in other sports and women in business and in every single walk of life,” she said. “we need to show our power and what women can do, so we can work more toward equality.”  thinking about that responsibility can be overwhelming, knight said. she spent all night thursday and all friday thinking about the bigger picture of this olympic victory.  she thought about it so much, and celebrated it so much as she sipped champagne and chatted with friends and family members, that she never even fell asleep thursday night.  friday she kept her gold medal in the pocket of her team u.s.a. jacket. she said she didn’t wear the medal because its ribbon pulls on her neck too much. it’s heavy.  “you want to hold it?” she asked me, opening up my hand and placing the gold medal in my palm.  and it was surprisingly heavy. about a pound and a quarter.  “it’s so cool, right?” she said, explaining how she’d place it, safe and sound, next to her pillow friday night. maybe she will even get some sleep.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — surpassing its own lofty expectations, norway has delivered the greatest performance in the history of the winter games, winning a total of 39 medals, 14 of them gold. a nation of only five million people has crushed all comers, including sports behemoths like germany and the united states, in the events norwegians care about the most.  elsewhere, these historic results would yield the kind of street parties where strangers high-five one another until their hands hurt. in norway, celebrations have been far more subdued. the most raucous it has gotten so far is a lot of joyful shouting at the television.  “we always want to win,” said fredrik aukland, a tv sports commentator in norway. “but modesty is a big part of the culture here. and norwegians don’t go out much.”  unless it’s constitution day, ostentatious displays of all kinds are frowned upon in norway, especially when it comes to wealth, a notable feature in one of the world’s richest countries. nobody expects a parade for returning athletes, even though they are bringing home 14 medals in cross-country, six in biathlon, five in ski jumping, seven in alpine skiing and four in speedskating.        the haul is sure to revive pangs of concern that have shadowed norway’s streak of victories in recent years — that the country may dominate some winter sports so thoroughly that it is ruining them.            image     marit bjoergen crossed the finish line ahead of sweden’s stina nilsson to give norway a gold medal in the women’s 4x5-kilometer cross-country relay at the pyeongchang games.   credit  matthias schrader/associated press         that anxiety is strongest in cross-country skiing, which is adored with a fervor that stretches back centuries. norwegians fear lopsided results can demolish enthusiasm for a sport in countries that are getting demolished.  justyna kowalczyk, an olympic athlete from poland who competed in pyeongchang, calls it a paradox. norway may love cross-country to death.  “it’s wonderful that they have a big budget, big sponsors and that everyone in norway loves skiing,” kowalczyk, who has won five olympic medals, said in a telephone interview. “but that makes it really difficult for countries like poland to compete.”        it isn’t unusual for one country to own a sport, at least for a while. the netherlands does it in speedskating, the united states in basketball. the difference is that norwegians say they desperately want cross-country skiing to gain a large, sustained following around the world, and that means nurturing an audience on television.  cross-country races are televised every weekend, from november to mid-april, to large swaths of europe. ratings in different nations rise when homegrown contenders are in the mix and shrink when they are not.  since 2011, when norway’s ascendant era began, viewership figures have dwindled by about 40 percent, said jurg capol, the marketing director of the international ski federation.            image        the start of the 50 kilometer mass start classic cross-country race on saturday.   credit  james hill for the new york times         “if the athlete from your country keeps finishing in 23rd place, you’re less likely to see the race in your country,” he said. “it’s all about results.”  to thrive, cross-country needs national heroes in places like germany, which has a population of more than 82 million. and while the united states, sweden and other countries have lately won some major titles, the norwegians took gold at all five of the women’s events at the world championships in finland last year, and won a total of 18 medals, more than any other country. norway won 15 in cross-country. the next-closest country won four.  all of this presents a conundrum for norwegians. they want their athletes to destroy everyone in their favorite sport, but the sport could be destroyed unless other countries win.        a similar tension is built into norway’s fortune, which comes from vast oil reserves and has turned the nation’s sovereign wealth fund into the largest in the world. norwegians are green to the core, and when it comes to their own energy needs, they are huge fans of the clean, renewable variety. they also pocket billions from fossil fuels.  a surfeit of gold and oil — bigger problems have plagued nations. but norway is not going to stop drilling, and it certainly won’t handicap its cross-country athletes.  “it’s a strange thing, but some people in norway yell at us when we win too much,” said knut nystad, who heads the team’s 30-person wax tech operation. “other countries dominate other sports. why is the argument against success made only in the sport where we’re succeeding?”            image        didrik toenseth of norway led the pack in first leg of the men&rsquo;s 4x10-kilometer cross-country relay, yet another event that resulted in gold for the norwegians.   credit  adam pretty/getty images         instead of holding back its athletes, norway is trying to lift others everywhere else. it has conceived the alpine athletics version of the marshall plan. for seven years, it has invited competitors from all over the world to visit for a weeklong training camp. a separate camp is offered to world cup coaches. attendees pay to get there, and norway covers all other expenses.  “we show them what works for us,” said erik roste, president of the norwegian ski federation. “we don’t have the blueprint, but we feel a responsibility to the international community, and we want to be open. we want to share our knowledge.”  of course, one week in norway will not suffice. the country’s pre-eminence stems from a long list of factors, only a few of which could be reproduced anywhere else. the most elusive is culturally embedded. in a sparsely populated nation covered with snow, a pair of skis has been indispensable, and countless children start to learn as toddlers.        this helps explain why the breadth and depth of passion for the sport has few parallels. love for cross-country became an essential national trait, one that any ingratiating foreigner has to embrace. even royalty. when norway voted to break its union with sweden in 1905, it recruited the son of denmark’s king to serve as monarch. the new king was given an invaluable piece of advice by a famous norwegian adventurer.  “fridtjof nansen told king haakon that he didn’t need to learn the language to win the hearts of norwegians,” roste said. “he needed to learn to ski. and he did.”  then there is norway’s abiding infatuation with its lush natural surroundings. people have such a deep bond with the landscape that there is a ubiquitous word for communing with it: friluftsliv, a.k.a. “open-air living.” the concept is so popular that nrk, the nation’s largest tv network, found a way for norwegians to enjoy it indoors.            image        kikkan randall, left, and jessica diggins gave the united states its first gold medal in cross-country skiing, in the team sprint. norway’s marit bjoergen, second from right, and maiken caspersen falla won the bronze.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         in 2011, the network placed a camera on the front of a boat called the ms nordnorge and ran live footage for  134 hours  of nothing but nature, quietly passing by. half of the country tuned in.  the love for nature and skiing has given rise to some 1,000 ski clubs. informal and low budget, many of them are driven by volunteers and overseen by parents. but they give the sport a vast and fertile grass-roots base.  at this olympics, one of norway’s breakout stars has been the 21-year-old johannes klaebo, who emerged from byasen idrettslag, a club in the city of trondheim, and won three cross-country gold medals. nobody had heard of him a year and a half ago.        “he could have been a great soccer player, he could have been great at any sport he chose,” said aukland, the sports commentator for nrk. “he chose cross-country skiing because it’s the most popular.”  which is why, at the highest levels, the sport has sponsors like banks, oil companies and insurers. these deep-pocketed benefactors help fund research and development as well as expensive equipment. this includes a two-story, 1,100-square-foot waxing truck with a state-of-the art ventilation system. it cost $1 million.  the combination of tradition, training and support is nearly impossible for other countries to match, which is why, here in pyeongchang, when other countries won, norwegian athletes occasionally sounded relieved to give up at least some of the spotlight. marit bjorgen became the winningest athlete in winter olympics history when she nabbed her 14th medal at the team sprint race. she took bronze. gold went to the united states, and silver to sweden.  in an interview after the race, bjorgen seemed sincerely pleased with the outcome.  “of course we were fighting for gold,” she said. “but it’s great to see the u.s. on the podium. it’s important for the sport.”       ',\n",

       " 'irena szewinska , a sprinter and long jumper who won seven medals in five olympic games, tying an olympic women’s record and becoming a national hero in poland, died on friday at a hospital in warsaw. she was 72.  the cause was cancer, said henryk urbas, the press spokesman for the polish olympic committee.  szewinska’s athletic accomplishments and long run of olympic appearances led many to consider her one of the greatest polish athletes of the 20th century. in a  tribute on twitter , president andrzej duda of poland called her “the first lady of polish sport,” and prime minister  mateusz morawiecki  called her “an inspiration for generations of polish athletes.”  a versatile, indefatigable athlete, szewinska set multiple world records; at one point she had the fastest times in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints. she stood a reedy 5 feet 9 inches tall and had a devastating kick, or last burst of speed, that sometimes let her snatch victory by a stride.  szewinska (pronounced sha-veen-ska) competed in her first olympic games in tokyo in 1964, when she was 18. she won silver medals in the 200-meter race and the long jump and a gold in the 400-meter relay.        in later olympics she won two more gold medals, in the 200-meter race at the mexico city games in 1968 and the 400-meter in montreal in 1976; and two bronzes, in the 100-meter in 1968 and the 200-meter at the munich games in 1972.  the only woman to win seven olympic medals for track and field events before szewinska was the australian runner and hurdler  shirley strickland , who won her medals in three games beginning in 1948.  the 400-meter finals in montreal in 1976 was one of szewinska’s most dramatic races. in the months before, she and the east german sprinter christina brehmer had both broken the world record for the 400-meter race, and now they were meeting in montreal.  szewinska pulled ahead in the last seconds of the race to beat brehmer by several meters for the gold medal. she had also set a new world record, 49.28 seconds — one that held until 1978, when the east german runner marita koch broke it.              image     szewinska at the international association of athletics federations indoor world championships in sopot, poland, in 2014. she was inducted into the association&rsquo;s hall of fame in 2012.   credit  alik keplicz/associated press         szewinska’s next, and last, olympics were not as exciting. she pulled a muscle at the 1980 games in moscow and retired soon after.  irena kirszenstein was born on may 24, 1946, to jakub and eugenia (rafalska) kirszenstein in what was then leningrad, russia. after the end of world war ii the family returned to poland and lived in warsaw, where a teacher first discovered her swiftness at a school competition.  in 1967 she married janusz szewinski, a hurdler and coach who later became a sports photographer. she earned a degree in economics from the university of warsaw in 1970.  in addition to her husband, with whom she lived in lomianki, outside warsaw, her survivors include two sons, andrzej and jaroslaw, and four grandchildren.  after her competitive career ended, szewinska worked for different athletic bodies and became an advocate for female athletes. over the course of her career she was a member of the international olympic committee and the international association of athletics federations’ women’s committee as well as the president of the polish women’s sport association.  szewinska’s olympic medals and world records were not her only honors. she was a five-time gold medalist at the european athletics championships and won more than two dozen times at the polish championships.  she was inducted into the international jewish sports hall of fame in 1981 and the international association of athletics federations’ hall of fame in 2012. four years later she received the order of the white eagle, poland’s highest award.

norway its first men’s downhill gold on thursday.  under a bright sky and a warm sun, svindal turned in a gutsy run on a winding but tame course that was almost perfectly suited to him. his teammate, kjetil jansrud, took the silver medal, finishing 0.12 of a second behind svindal in a triumphant showing for the country that has won more medals than any other at the winter olympics but is better known for its prowess in nordic sports.  beat feuz of switzerland finished 0.18 of a second behind svindal and won bronze.  all three medal winners were lucky enough to be among the first 10 skiers on a day when the sun was heating up and slowing down the snow with each passing minute.   svindal, one of the elder statesmen of the alpine circuit at 35, blasted out of the starting gate, poling and skating his way down the initial slope. midway through his run he lost his balance, went upright in the middle of the jump and landed on the back of his skis 20 feet down the hill. svindal somehow regained his stability though and ended up gaining speed on the relatively flat and winding third quarter of the course where so many other races were losing time.        at nearly 6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds, svindal had gravity on his side and crossed the finish line at 1 minute 40.25 seconds, besting the time feuz had posted just minutes earlier. before long, it was clear no one was going to catch the norwegians. with a dozen skiers still at the top of the mountain, finishers began making their way over to svindal to congratulate him.  — matthew futterman             image        aljona

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — gus kenworthy was nursing a hip hematoma, a broken right thumb and a bruised ego after a 12th-place finish in the men’s ski slopestyle final, the same event where he won the silver medal four years ago.  speaking on sunday while the ceremony introducing the medalists proceeded without him at phoenix snow park in pyeongchang, south korea, kenworthy said, “it’s all good.”  this is kenworthy’s second olympics but his first as an openly gay athlete. he and adam rippon, the only other openly gay male athlete on the united states team, will not leave here with individual gold medals, but they are among the biggest american stars at these games.  at the 2014 sochi games, kenworthy reached out to the singer miley cyrus on social media and asked if she would be his valentine. here at the pyeongchang games, kenworthy, 26, has engaged in physical displays of affection with men in public. he gave rippon a peck on the cheek during the opening ceremony and kissed his boyfriend, matthew wilkas, before sunday’s qualifying runs.        if kenworthy had to choose between winning a medal while leading a closeted existence or failing to grace the podium while living an authentic life, it wouldn’t be close.            image     after a disappointing finish on sunday, kenworthy removed his helmet and shrugged.   credit  dylan martinez/reuters         “if you look at me, i’m bummed but i’m not sulking, i’m not crying,” he said, adding, “being out at these games has kind of meant the world to me, just getting to really be myself and be authentic. and i think landing a run in the final and getting on the podium obviously would have been icing on the cake, but even though it didn’t happen for me i still had a wonderful olympic experience.”  in sochi, the united states swept the podium, with joss christensen taking the gold and nick goepper the bronze. on sunday, goepper scored 93.60 on his third and final jump to vault into second place, behind norway’s oystein braaten. alex beaulieu-marchand of canada earned the bronze.  kenworthy qualified for the finals with a second-run score of 90.80, but he could not put together a complete run in the end. of his three attempts, his third showed the most promise, but he bailed on the final stretch after he said he became “wobbly” on his edges.        “i wasn’t able to set up my next jumps and i tried to think on the fly and compensate and come up with something else but it didn’t work,” he said. at the finish line, he removed his helmet and shrugged.  on the eve of the slopestyle final, kenworthy and his boyfriend attended the men’s free skate to support rippon, where they proudly waved a rainbow flag. kenworthy said he was unaware that a television camera had recorded his pre-competition kiss with wilkas.          “i think that’s amazing,” he said. “that’s something i wanted at the last olympics, to share a kiss with my boyfriend at the bottom and it was something i was too scared to do for myself. and so to be able to do that, to give him a kiss and have that affection broadcast for the world is incredible.”  “that’s not something i had as a kid,” he added. “i didn’t see a gay athlete at the olympics kissing their boyfriend. i think if i had it would have made it a lot easier for me.”       ',\n",
       " 'gangneung, south korea — out there on the ice at the pyeongchang olympics, with nearly 12,000 fans watching in the arena and millions tuning in on tv, nathan chen was finally alone.  gone from his head were the marketers, reporters, coaches, publicists and fans who had labeled him america’s next olympic star.  gone, too, were the expectations for him to win a medal as the best american figure skater of his generation. a dreadful 17th-place finish in the short program had taken care of that.  enough, already, he said to himself.  enough of that noise.  “honestly, i just didn’t care anymore,” chen said on saturday after his free skate. “i was like, all right, screw it.”        chen, an 18-year-old from salt lake city, wiped from  his brain his mistake-laden short program  and the other terrible short program he skated — in the team event last week. and he set out to write a much better ending to his olympic story.  without telling his coach, chen added another quadruple jump to his free skate and ended up landing six quads in total, five cleanly, more than anyone ever has in olympic competition. at the end of the men’s competition, his unprecedented effort had launched him into fifth place over all.            image     chen performing his short program on friday. his routine on saturday helped erase some memories of that rough day.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         indeed, he won the free skate with a score of 215.08, about 9 points ahead of japan’s yuzuru hanyu, who ended up with the gold medal. while chen’s performance wasn’t enough to put him on the podium, his comeback stood for something deeper. it’s how nathan chen went from lost to found.  shoma uno, the silver medalist from japan, said he was glad to see chen bounce back.  “he’s very consistent at the practice, all the time,” uno said. “in the free skate, nathan was more like nathan.”        leading up to the olympics, chen was an amazing nathan — the only international skater who was undefeated this season on the grand prix circuit. known as the quad king because he’s so good at the four-rotation jump, he was anointed as a medal contender long before the olympics began. even before he was named to the united states olympic team in january, he was featured on boxes of cornflakes. he was one of the biggest names to watch for.  so when he stumbled so profoundly here, people noticed.  his jumps went sour  in both the men’s program and the team event, and he was dumbfounded as to what went wrong. because for chen, who is young enough to be applying to colleges, things had never gone so very wrong.  “i’ve never been in this position before,” he said before he took to the ice one last time for the free skate. “i don’t know what to do.”  he insisted that the pressure of the olympics had not gotten to him. but on the inside, there was a battle ensuing.  he was trying to swat away negative thoughts, but they kept coming at him. he had worried about winning a medal at the olympics and where he would place. he didn’t want to make a mistake — so he skated tentatively because of that and made mistakes because of that.            image        without telling his coach, chen added a quadruple jump to his program and ended up in fifth place over all.   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         after the men’s short program, chen didn’t even wait for the draw to find out when he would perform in the free skate. he headed back to his room and then his mother called to give him a pep talk.        “this isn’t who you are,” she said. “tomorrow’s a new day.”  he crawled under his bed covers. there, all alone with his mind racing, he tried to determine what went wrong.  he had started skating when he was 3, when his mother would reward him with swedish fish candy for doing things right. and he often did things right — for years and years, he did things right. and now he grew more and more angry with himself that he had let the olympics overwhelm him.  “these kinds of things happen to every athlete eventually, but it’s nothing that nathan is accustomed to,” the figure skating analyst and 1984 olympic gold medalist scott hamilton said. “what i see is a highly tuned athlete who might have been thrown off a bit for one reason or another. quads are extremely specific in their timing, aggression and in their intent. when things start to unravel just a little bit, it’s like, ‘boom!’ ”  boom — just like the revelation chen had in bed on friday night.  forget about the expectations that everyone had placed on him to medal, he said to himself. forget the mistakes in the team event and the mistakes in the short program.  forget it all. forget everyone.  he would try that sixth quad.  “i was, like, i’m not going to hold myself back and play it safe,” he said. “i had literally nothing to lose, so if i made a couple of mistakes, so be it.”  before his free skate, chen spent time on social media, where fans and friends were reaching out to him.              dick button, the two-time olympic champion, posted back-to-back notes. first, he said, “nathan chen — it will be interesting to see how he handles the worst disaster in his skating life.”        second, he said, “hey nathan chen, beyoncé fell off the stage at a concert and got right back up, so can you.”  donovan mitchell, the utah jazz guard, tweeted, “stay positive.”  but chen had already decided his plan.  on saturday, in his redemption skate, he wore a simple black costume with a white collar, and he leapt and leapt — six times in all — to land his quads and make history.  afterward, there were no tears. he just snacked on a pb&amp;j sandwich while waiting to see if he would somehow end the day in the top three. maybe, just maybe, he would finish that high. but it wasn’t meant to be.  there will always be the what-ifs — as in, what if he had cleared his head early enough in these olympics to skate like the real nathan chen? he didn’t, until it was too late. for now, that will have to suffice.  “i’m happy that i did what i did in the end,” he said.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the idea of redemption has always made the snowboard cross star lindsey jacobellis weary, because, in her mind, she did nothing that needed to be redeemed. yet after  her infamous fall  at the 2006 winter olympics in turin, where she spun gold into silver by falling near the finish line with a big lead, that is the way her olympics career has been framed.  it was that way in vancouver in 2010, and sochi in 2014. both times, jacobellis, the most accomplished athlete in the sport’s history, stumbled in the semifinals, leaving without a medal.  twelve years later, most of them spent dominating the world cup circuit, she was back in the olympics championship race, called the big final.  again she left without a medal — by 0.03 seconds.  jacobellis finished fourth, missing the medal stand by about half the length of a snowboard. she led the final race midway through the curling course of rises and jumps but was passed on the bottom half. she avoided a crash near the finish line and came across a fraction of a second behind eva samkova of the czech republic, who won gold four years ago and bronze this time.        michela moioli of italy won the gold medal, and julia pereira de sousa mabileau of france earned silver.  friday’s race on a sunny afternoon at phoenix snow park felt far removed from 12 years ago, except that the memory of that slip-up in turin has followed jacobellis throughout her career. it spikes every four years at the olympics, where she is rarely celebrated for her consistency atop the sport, for her world championships, world cup and x games victories, as much as remembered for one unforced error as a 20-year-old.            image     jacobellis, in the blue bib, was leading halfway through the final race but was passed on the second half.   credit  mike blake/reuters         she has a “very strong love-hate relationship” with the olympics, she said last fall.  in 2006, jacobellis had a big lead in the final and, on the second-to-last jump, added a stylish flourish that pulled her off balance before she crashed into the snow. a competitor raced past before jacobellis recovered for second place.  before pyeongchang, at the nudge of the u.s. snowboarding coach peter foley,  jacobellis worked with a new york-based mental coach  named denise shull for about the past 18 months. shull, with a background in finance, had never worked with an athlete, and took a different approach than most sports psychologists. she told jacobellis to embrace her fear and anxiety, not try to pretend it is not there. the idea was that those memories would inevitably creep back into the performance, so jacobellis might as well hold them out in the open.        jacobellis, 32, had the fourth-fastest time in the morning’s qualifying heats, where riders compete alone against a clock to secure seeding for the group races.  she cruised to a first-place finish in her quarterfinal heat. she got out front fast and, aided by early wipeouts behind her, sailed to the finish just in front of canadian tess critchlow.  she glided in similar fashion with a second-place finish in her semifinal heat. that put her right back where she was 12 years ago — out front again.  but leads are rarely safe in snowboard cross. she was passed by one rider on a midcourse jump, then another on the subsequent curve. another slipped past on the final series of jumps, and jacobellis could not make it up.  there was no fall. there was no big mistake. there was just a four-time olympian heading out of the finish area as three women less-decorated in the sport celebrated their new prizes.

       " 'the united states has displaced russia atop the overall medals standings for the 2014 winter games in sochi, following a new set of penalties related to the russian doping scandal.  the international olympic committee on wednesday announced lifetime bans against four russian skeleton racers, ordering them to return two additional medals from sochi. the decision makes for a total 10 russian olympians who have been disqualified after  revelations  of state-sponsored doping at the 2014 games.  russia dominated the standings at sochi, where  investigators last year said  an elaborate cheating operation involving the federal security service had allowed the nation’s athletes to use prohibited substances throughout competition and go undetected.  at those games, russia won 33 medals, 13 of them gold. the international olympic committee has stripped six medals from cross-country skiers and skeleton racers, leaving russia with 27. the united states won 28 medals at the sochi games.        russia is now tied for the most gold medals with norway, formerly the second-place finisher.  among the athletes disciplined on wednesday were elena nikitina, who won bronze in sochi, and alexander tretyakov, who won gold.  like most winter sports officials, officials from the sport of skeleton had not prevented nikitina or tretyakov from competing as the investigations against them continued over the last year.  four days before her penalty was announced, nikitina  won  a world cup skeleton race in park city, utah, a key competition ahead of the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang, from which she is now barred.  nikitina’s olympic medal is due to go to katie uhlaender of the united states, a three-time olympian who finished fourth in sochi and  wondered since last may  if she was due a bronze.  tretyakov’s sanction elevates martins dukurs of latvia to gold and matthew antoine, an american, to silver. tomass dukurs of latvia moves up to bronze.        some sports officials have requested there be a medal reallocation ceremony for athletes like uhlaender and dukurs at the 2018 games in february.  investigations are continuing into at least 17 other russian olympians who competed in sochi and have been implicated in the doping program. all inquiries are not expected to conclude by the time of the winter games.  some of the sanctioned russian athletes have appealed the disciplinary decisions to the global sports arbitration court. thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee, told the new york times this month that he was confident the decisions were legally sound and would ultimately withstand those challenges.  “the discussion is about the procedures and due process, and you know that due process takes time,” bach said.  as antidoping authorities have agitated for broader punishment of russia’s olympic team for the systematic cheating in sochi, bach is poised to announce penalties for the nation on dec. 5 in switzerland.  russia’s president vladimir v. putin, who was actively involved in preparations for the sochi games, has been outspoken about the doping scandal, angrily disputing state involvement. this month, he  called  the first wave of olympic sanctions a conspiracy to “incite discontent among sports fans, athletes” in russia and influence his country’s presidential election in march.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — a team of two american women ended one of the longest droughts in u.s. olympic sports on wednesday.  kikkan randall and jessie diggins won the women’s team sprint freestyle race at the pyeongchang games, outsprinting more heralded teams from sweden and norway to become the first americans to win an olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing.  they are the first american cross country skiers to medal at the olympics since bill koch took home a silver in 1976, 15,367 days ago.  “hearing it out loud, it still doesn’t feel real,” said randall, a five-time olympian. “it’s what i’ve been working on for 20 years and with this team for the last five years and, wow, it’s just so fun to put it together tonight, finally.”        the win was especially sweet for diggins. she had finished in the top six in each of her four olympic events before the sprint relay, and missed a medal in the 10-kilometer freestyle last week by 3.3 seconds.  she came into wednesday’s race undeterred, saying she would not have hung around the games if she had lost hope about winning a medal. then, under the lights on a chilly but calm night at alpensia cross-country skiing center, diggins came off the final hill in third place on this winding up-and-down track and took a big risk — gambling on the widest of turns at nearly 30 miles per hour, she momentarily drifted outside the track to create the space she needed to dart ahead of maiken falla of norway. in the final straightaway, diggins chased down stina nilsson of sweden and outstretched her at the finish to win by 19-hundredths of a second. norway claimed the bronze.  diggins collapsed in the snow, and soon randall was piling on top of her, celebrating a moment decades in the making.  randall said the first words out of diggins’s mouth were, “oh my gosh, did we just win the olympics?”        “it feels unreal; i can’t believe it just happened,” diggins said. “but we’ve been feeling so good these entire games, and just having it happen at a team event means so much more to me than any individual medal ever would.”            image     diggins, bottom, and kikkan randall after their victory. they are the first americans to win an olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing.    credit  antonio bat/european pressphoto agency         randall and diggins blasted through the semifinals, winning their heat with a time of 16:22.56, more than 10 seconds faster than the norwegians, who also won their heat. the question was whether the americans had burned too much energy claiming one of the 10 places in the final, and if they would have enough left to win it.  they did.  “in the final stretch i was just thinking, go, go, go, i’m giving it everything i had and i’ve got someone who i really love and care about waiting for me at the finishing line and i just want to make her proud,” diggins said.  the americans’ winning time — 15:56.47 — was a 26-second improvement on their semifinal effort. but the gold was not their first milestone.  in 2013, randall and diggins won  a world championship gold medal  — the first for the united states — by taking the women’s team sprint by almost eight seconds. in 2017, they won individual medals at the worlds: diggins took home the silver in the sprint and randall the bronze. diggins also won the bronze in the team sprint at that meet, skiing with sadie bjornsen.  those achievements produced high expectations for the american women in pyeongchang. a book has been written about them, and the u.s. ski and snowboard association promoted them extensively heading into the games. but american women have arrived at the olympics before with a decent shot at a medal, only to be stymied by their rivals from europe.  that situation seemed to be repeating itself through the first 11 days of these games. diggins finished fifth in the women’s skiathlon, the highest olympic finish to that point for a united states woman, but out of the medals.        then she was sixth in the sprint, running out of gas in the finals. then came the 3.3-second miss in the 10-kilometer race. “i pushed my body so far past its limits i’m actually kind of amazed i didn’t pass out on that final climb,” she  wrote on instagram .  sprinting — especially uphill — is her specialty, though, and this course, which includes two nasty ascents, gave her and randall an opportunity for a prize that had eluded american skiers for more than four decades.  the team sprint — especially on this brutal course — is a sadistic event. it requires two skiers to take turns skiing three legs each of 1.25 kilometers. with two rounds of racing for the top 10 teams, that means six all-out sprints for each skier, with a little more than an hour to recover between the semifinals and the final.  diggins and randall skied as if they have been winning on the biggest stages for years. diggins all but locked up a medal on the fourth leg, pushing into first place and building a 10-second cushion.            who won the most medals and more olympics questions, answered  the world’s best athletes schussed down the slopes, zoomed down the track and skated across the ice in south korea. here’s what you want to know about this year’s events.       that was when luke bodensteiner, an official with the u.s. ski and snowboard association and a former olympian, said he saw the race shift. “at that point, you could see they started skiing to win, not just skiing to medal,” he said.  diggins tagged randall to start the fifth leg, and with her pink streaked blond ponytail peeking out of her headband, randall broke away with skiers from norway and sweden in a lead pack, building a gap of more than 50 meters.        then it was diggins’s turn to battle two of the best skiers in the world for the gold. with strong sprinters by her side, she said she knew “i needed everyone else to get pretty tired if i have a shot.”  only a disastrous fall — not out of the question, given the united states team’s history of bad luck and the steep descents here — was going to keep the americans off the podium.  diggins grew up cross-country skiing, joining the minnesota youth ski league at age 4 and then competing as a varsity athlete at stillwater high school, where cross country meets are held on golf courses around the twin cities. she has become a celebrity in her home state, where people have been rising before dawn during the games to watch her race.  randall, an alaska native, was the first american woman to break into the elite of international cross-country skiing, and there was a long period in which she was the only woman on the united states team. during the first part of her career, she worked selling shoes in a sporting goods store to support herself during the off-seasons.  she won the world cup sprint titles in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and she arrived at the sochi olympics widely expected to end the united states’ cross-country medal drought. but, unknown to all but those closest to her, she had strained her back during a three-and-half-hour practice session before the games. the injury threw off her training, dooming her chances at a medal.  randall skipped the 2015-16 season to have her first child, then returned to the world cup circuit in the fall of 2016, toting along her son, breck.  in the final on wednesday, randall’s and diggins’s teammates were on the fence next to the course, urging them on.  “the door has been opened,” randall said, pointing to the recent success of young skiers at international events. “what i hope this gold medal really means is that those kids dream about being in this position someday, and they really feel it’s possible.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — at the world cup races late last month, marcel hirscher of austria told his longtime american rival ted ligety that he was planning to skip the alpine combined event at the winter olympics.  ligety laughed at hirscher and told him he would see him at the race’s starting gate.  hirscher, ski racing’s most dominant athlete since 2011, has had a tangled relationship with the olympics. for all his many accomplishments, which include a record six consecutive world cup overall titles and 55 world cup victories, an olympic gold medal had eluded him, an outcome that vexed him after two previous olympic appearances.  it had gotten to the point that hirscher preferred to make jokes about whether he would ever win a gold medal.            image     hirscher reacted after finishing the slalom section of the alpine combined. as recently as last month, he had been saying he would skip the event.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “we have enough olympic champions from austria,” hirscher said with a shrug of his shoulders when asked late last season about his expectations for the 2018 games.        but there is now one more austrian alpine olympic champion and he is most certainly glad he showed up for the first alpine event of the pyeongchang games.  “i have my big gold medal,” hirscher said with a wide grin late tuesday after defeating alexis pinturault of france by 0.23 of a second in the alpine combined, which includes one run of downhill and one run of slalom. victor muffat-jeandet, pinturault’s teammate, won the bronze medal.  asked how often he had been questioned about whether he would ever win at the olympics, hirscher answered, “i mean, every day, but now it’s over.”  hirscher’s victory came on a windblown day when he unexpectedly finished in 12th place in the morning downhill portion, which is not his strength. his specialty is the slalom and giant slalom events. but the gusting conditions had forced officials to shorten the downhill course, which benefited hirscher because the downhill specialists did not have as long a distance to build a bigger lead on those that are more accomplished at slalom.            image        “i have my big gold medal,” hirscher said on tuesday.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         then, in the afternoon slalom stage, hirscher was at his finest, vastly outperforming the field in the final 150 yards, where the racecourse became considerably steeper.  and so the gap in hirscher’s splendid racing résumé was filled, alleviating much of the pressure hirscher was feeling at these olympics, which he has called his last. though just 28 years old, he has said he does not expect to be racing by 2022. but he could now win three gold medals at pyeongchang.  hirscher’s victory was also the 115th olympic alpine medal for an austrian skier, the most by any nation in any sport at the winter games.  ligety, a two-time olympic champion who once dominated hirscher in the giant slalom, was fifth on tuesday, a notable result given that injuries have limited his ability to race in the last two seasons. ligety seemed pleased to see his rival realize a milestone achievement.  “he didn’t need it for people to know what an amazing skier he is,” ligety said. “but, of course, you want to win at every level.”       ',\n",
       " 'gangneung, south korea — john shuster, the face of american curling for the past four winter olympics — and all the good and bad those experiences have entailed — had a gold medal draped around his neck for the first time in his life on saturday.  moments before, he and his teammates had done what jubilant curlers do: they raised their brooms aloft in screaming excitement over an improbable victory. yet at that moment, it was hard to believe how close his dream had come to crumbling apart.  last sunday, after a loss to norway, the americans were on the brink of elimination, again.  after that game, with family headed to a hotel and his wife’s encouraging words ringing in his head, shuster, 35, found a grassy spot outside the venue, sat down and came to a realization.  “this is silly,” he told himself. “i’m getting my heart broken, i feel like, by this sport — and this is silly. seriously, this is the olympics.”        he slept soundly that night for the first time in a long time. his team did not lose again.  five consecutive victories culminated saturday night in something that has never happened before: an olympic gold for the american curlers as they defeated sweden, 10-7, before a flag-waving throng from back home. shuster and his four teammates — tyler george, matt hamilton, john landsteiner and joe polo, who served as the team’s alternate — defeated sweden, the top-ranked team in the world, so soundly that it conceded the match with several rocks to play in the 10th and final end.  the victory was as decisive as it was unexpected — to everyone, perhaps, but the americans themselves, who described themselves as a group of scrappy regular guys from middle america.  “this,” george said, “is a team that never gives up.”  the united states is not known as a curling powerhouse. americans had never won a gold medal in the sport. for that reason and more, members of the team expressed hope that curling would become more than a cultural curiosity every four years. perhaps the team’s success here can help.  “we want our sport to be loved by our country as much as we love it,” george, 35, said. “there’s a reason why we play it, and there’s a reason why we love it as much as we do.”  the win came with its share of thrills.  on saturday, shuster delivered the biggest shot in the history of american curling when he cleared two swedish stones with his final rock of the eighth end to score 5 points.        “during the entire end, we could kind of feel it building,” shuster said. “their margin for error got incredibly small.”  shuster had executed a perfect shot: a blend of cool-handed finesse and foolproof strategy. his team’s lead was suddenly insurmountable.            image     matt hamilton wiped away tears as he stood with his teammates after they received their gold medals.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “we knew we were going to lose,” niklas edin of sweden said.  this was shuster’s fourth consecutive olympic appearance, and he has experienced all the joy and heartbreak that the games can offer. after helping the united states to a bronze medal at the 2006 turin games, the americans’ next two trips to the olympics were unmitigated disasters: last place in 2010 and next-to-last place in 2014.  it got so bad that the word “shuster” was  added to the urban dictionary . (definition? “a verb meaning to fail to meet expectations, particularly at a moment critical for success or even slightly respectable results,” as in “man, he really shustered that!”) then, in the summer of 2014, shuster was sidelined from u.s.a. curling’s high-performance program.  “everything happens for a reason,” said shuster, a part-time sales associate for a sporting goods store in duluth, minn.  he found three fellow curlers from small-town minnesota and wisconsin who still believed in him: george, a liquor salesman who  competes in eight-year-old sneakers  with holes in them; hamilton, 29, a technician for a consumer products company and a sweeping wizard renowned for his mustache; and landsteiner, 27, an engineer.        the team became known in curling circles as team reject, a moniker it came to embrace. and the curlers began the slow climb back to respectability, through the national ranks, through the olympic trials and through the olympic bonspiel, or tournament, here in south korea, where they surmounted all kinds of obstacles.  the united states had to beat canada — canada! — twice in four days just to reach the final. (canada is really good at curling.)  “from the day that the 2014 olympics came to an end, every single day was with this journey in mind,” shuster said.  that much was clear as the members of team reject stood together atop the medal podium. their journey was complete.  here’s how it happened:  1st end: sweden keeps the hammer  following warm-ups and the ceremonial blaring of bagpipes (curling is a scottish game), both teams have hit the ice. there is a huge contingent of american fans in the building, and some of them may have had refreshments this afternoon. anyway, amid cheers of “u-s-a” and “shoooooo” for john shuster, the american skip, the swedish team took the hammer in the first end, owing to their top seed in the tournament, and preserved it for the second end with a blank, meaning nobody scored.  oh, the hammer? glad you asked. the hammer belongs to the team that gets to throw the last rock in an end, which is a huge tactical advantage. a team keeps the hammer until it scores.  as a special treat, we’ll be joined here by  devin heroux of cbc sports , a curling aficionado who will offer his incisive analysis. devin suddenly has some spare time on his hands because canada — well, canada didn’t do so hot here. more on that later.         devin heroux:  these two teams are playing in their first-ever gold medal game at the olympics. we’ll see how usa and sweden handle this new territory and the pressure of the moment.            image        swedish skip nik edin watching the stone.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         swedish skip nik edin has won world championships and knows big game pressure. american skip john shuster has been around the sport for a long time, including winning bronze with pete fenson’s team at the 2006 olympics.  expect these first couple ends (maybe more) to be wide open as both teams get a feel for the ice and calm their nerves. it should also be pointed out that edin likes to play an open style of curling and pounce on opposition mistakes — the americans haven’t made many in their five-game winning streak.  2nd end: sweden makes shuster pay for miss  we’re seeing some high-level curling from both sides. the swedes packed the second end with exquisite shotmaking, and when john shuster misfired on a double takeout with his last stone of the end, nik edin took advantage, scoring two for sweden. edin is widely regarded as the best skip in the world for a reason. opponents pay for making mistakes against him.  also, ivanka trump is here with a swarm of secret service personnel.   devin heroux:  edin learned how to curl by watching past canadian curling championship games on vhs tapes while growing up in sweden. in fact, his favorite curler to watch was kevin martin. he studied his strategy and learned the game by watching tapes over and over.  edin moved his team to canada two years ago for a year to practice in the curling-crazed nation and compete against the top teams there. his team is fully funded by the swedish government to curl. this is their full-time job, to curl and win a gold medal at the olympics.        3rd end: americans tie match, 2-2  tyler george, the american vice skip who wears  really ratty sneakers , made two outstanding shots to set up shuster, who came through in a huge way: a double takeout on his last throw to score two for the americans and tie the match. more chants of “u-s-a!” are filling this place.  throughout their run here, the members of the american team have given huge credit to dr. carly anderson, who came on as u.s.a. curling’s sports psychologist after their dismal showing at the 2014 winter olympics in sochi.  “we’ve had team meetings where we’re kind of slumping, and she’s just tough on us,” matt hamilton said in an interview before the start of the olympics. “she’ll tell us, ‘you guys have to pull your heads out of your butts!’ she’ll tell it how it is.”  anderson has worked with the players in individual and group sessions. a huge emphasis, she said, has been developing strategies to help them execute in pressure situations. so far, so good.   devin heroux:  in this third end, it was all about placement of stones and getting the proper angles. edin changed the end around by making a double and rolling perfectly. this is how precise the game has become. but a slight error by edin on his last rock allowed shuster a tough double takeout and he threw his rock perfectly to score two.  sweden likes low-scoring battles. they wait for their opponents to crack. the usa has hung tough with teams throughout this olympic competition. we’ll see how shuster and his team handle the added pressure of this game, though. sweden is the top-ranked team in the world right now. usa has the ability to play a simple style of curling but can also complicate the game and draw opponents into making mistakes. many curlers in the game say shuster has the ability to single-handedly win a curling game because of his shotmaking brilliance. he’ll need to do that today to propel the americans to their first gold at the olympics.        4th end: americans steal a point  “yep! yep! whoa! whoa!” this is the soundtrack being provided at the moment by the americans, who are putting all sorts of pressure on the swedes. after a measurement, the united states stole a point (sweden had the hammer) to take their first lead of the match. this is heady stuff for john shuster and his teammates. it sounds as if all of duluth is here at gangneung curling centre, and these people are screaming.            image        fans cheer for the united states team during their gold-medal victory.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         the measurement stick is a tool that’s used when it’s impossible to tell with the naked eye which rock is closest to the button.   devin heroux:  it was textbook american curling in the 4th end. shuster and his team love to complicate the game and force their opponents into making mistakes. and that’s exactly what happened. edin had a bad miss with his first. shuster applied more pressure and on edin’s last throw he was a little heavy and wide giving up a steal to the americans.  what’s important about this steal is now the swedes have last rock in the odd ends. americans want to force sweden to a single point in the 5th end and try to keep the last rock in the 6th, 8th and 10th and final end. that’s how they’ll try to play this game out, to have last rock advantage for the last shot of the game.  5th end: sweden leads at the break  john shuster was heavy on his last stone, which flashed the house, meaning it rolled straight through without touching anything, and sweden capitalized, scoring two to regain the lead as we head into the fifth-end break. (that’s halftime to you football fans.) the pressure is mounting.  but remember: the americans won four straight matches heading into this final. their chemistry has never been better. also, mr. t told them to win. i pity the fool who disappoints mr. t.   devin heroux:  it was more textbook american curling in the 5th end — cluttered, confusing and messy, which is exactly how this team wins games. shuster likes a lot of rocks in play and loves to put pressure on his opponents. sweden has fallen into the trap and are struggling to escape it. when shuster has a lead, he plays with tremendous confidence.        but the game can be unforgiving. shuster was heavy on his last shot and edin made a perfect draw shot to score two points. it takes eight made shots to score in this game. shuster missed one. edin didn’t.  6th end: shuster makes edin pay for mistake  niklas edin, the swedish skip, missed just to the left on his second-to-last throw of the end, leaving an american stone in the house. it was a small but significant blunder, and edin doesn’t usually make small but significant blunders. the americans are getting their opportunities, and john shuster made two solid shots to ultimately score two. the united states pulls back ahead.   devin heroux:  when you get to this level of curling, the slightest error can be the difference. edin missed a tough run back takeout on his first shot, allowing the americans to put two rocks in the house.  edin tried a hit and roll on his last shot and missed again. shuster made him pay with a perfect draw shot and a score of two.  one of the big things to consider is how the teams read the ice throughout the game. the ice conditions change throughout the game due to rocks sliding over and over the ice. it can also change because of the body heat in the building, creating frost on the ice. the players have to adapt. the teams that are able to do this first win the game.  7th end: sweden’s edin feeling the pressure  niklas edin, the finest curler in the world, appears to be feeling that olympic pressure. after another huge miss with his first shot of the seventh end, he bounced back to save a point for sweden with the hammer, tying the score. but the united states is in great shape, with the hammer heading to the eighth — and on track to have it in the 10th.            image        the united states’ george tyler, center, yelling at matt hamilton, right and john landsteiner.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         john shuster is more than deserving of the accolades he’s gotten during this bonspiel (curling talk for tournament), but his teammates have been outstanding. matt hamilton, the mustachioed social media hero for the americans, executed a brilliant double takeout in the middle of the seventh end. and tyler george, whose shots set up shuster at the back of each end, has been one of the sharpest players on the ice.   devin heroux:  curling is one of few sports where adrenaline can be a bad thing — curlers have to calm their nerves and settle down before throwing big shots. right now it looks like this young swedish team is letting their nerves and adrenaline get the better of them. they are missing routine shots. edin said that was his one concern, that they would let the pressure of the moment get to them.  edin, however, has been here before in these pressure games and made one of the more remarkable shots of the olympic tournament to score a single in the 7th end. it’s a shot that might have saved the game for his team. but shuster’s team looks calm and confident with three ends left to decide this gold medal game.  8th end: americans pile on five points  john shuster just nailed the most important shot in american curling history: a double takeout for five points and a seemingly insurmountable lead for the americans entering the ninth end. the gold is all but theirs. the crowd is going bananas.   devin heroux:  the americans have been putting pressure on sweden the entire game. you could see it and sense it in the building. the pressure was on and in the 8th end sweden cracked.  a massive score of five in the 8th end by the united states has all but sealed this victory for a team that was once in jeopardy of missing the olympic curling playoffs all together. it is a remarkable story about how this shuster team never stopped believing and are now narrowing in on the country’s first gold medal in curling.  9th end: sweden gets two back  the united states, playing conservatively, gave up two to sweden here in the ninth end, but still has a 10-7 lead (and the hammer) entering the 10th and final end. it would take a meltdown of intergalactic proportions for john shuster &amp; co. to lose this match.         devin heroux:  john shuster has curled for a very long time. he’s had some serious low points throughout his career. but he never stopped playing the game he loves. he has kids now. he talks about them often and how different his perspective is in life and curling.  this is his moment now. he’s a few rocks away from being the first-ever olympic curling champion from the united states, alongside his team.  10th end: sweden goes down quietly   devin heroux:  it is one of the more improbable comebacks in the history of curling — and perhaps sports.  team shuster was on the ropes and seemingly down and out at the olympics. with a 2-4 record and three games left in the tournament, shuster couldn’t afford to lose another game. the team got on a roll and started believing they could win it all. that belief propelled them to wins over the canadian curling juggernauts and then over the no. 1-ranked team in the world, sweden, to capture olympic gold.  it’s a historic win. the country’s first. but how they did it is even more incredible.

       " 'ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik of north korea are not expected to win a medal in pairs figure skating at the 2018 winter olympics in south korea. but few athletes may have a more impactful presence next month at the games, which are being promoted as a chance to ease political and nuclear tensions on the divided korean peninsula after north korea announced tuesday that it would participate in the games.  the pairs team, which finished 15th at the world skating championships last year, is expected to represent the height of sporting aspirations for north korea. details are still being worked out about which athletes will compete, but ryom, who will turn 19 just days before the olympics begin, and kim, who is 25, are the only north koreans who have qualified for the 2018 games.  they are the lone elite, world-class winter athletes from the isolated nation, which has only won two medals at the winter games, a silver and bronze in speedskating, the last coming in 1992, and they have plenty of admirers among figure skating’s cognoscenti.  “they are so charismatic; i know the crowd would fall for them with their smile and passion and love of skating,” bruno marcotte, a prominent canadian pairs coach who worked with the skaters last summer in montreal and during an olympic qualifying competition in germany in september, said by phone on tuesday. “i feel they’ll be a crowd favorite.”        thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee, has made north korea’s participation a priority during the past year, and he said in a statement tuesday that north korea’s decision to take part in the 2018 winter games was “a great step forward in the olympic spirit.”  the olympic ideal has long been tarnished by scandal and prohibitive costs that make the games unaffordable to many cities. but the i.o.c., since its founding in the 19th century, has prided itself on the olympics serving as essentially a peace movement. they are meant to show that the world’s nations and athletes can come together and, if only for a brief period, the chance of conflict can be lessened.  for those who still subscribe to that ideal, hopes soared tuesday. “this is going to put a positive vibe into those games,” mr. marcotte said.  there is, too, a widely-expressed hope among south korean officials and international sports officials and athletes that north korea’s unpredictable leader, kim jong-un, will be less likely to behave provocatively during the olympics if his country’s athletes are participating.  last week, the north korean ruler boasted that the united states was within range of a nuclear arsenal he could operate with a button on his desk. president donald j. trump responded on twitter by bragging about the nuclear capabilities of the united states and the size of his button.        the jousting evoked somber olympic memories from three decades ago. ten months before the 1988 summer games were held in seoul, the south korean capital, north korean agents placed a bomb aboard a korean air flight and killed all 115 aboard in what south korean officials said was an attempt to undermine those olympics. north korea boycotted those games.  at the last major international sporting event held in south korea, soccer’s 2002 world cup, north korea provoked a naval skirmish with the south on the day that south korea played a match for third place.  but, on various fields of play, the two countries have been on convivial terms lately. last year, north korea sent its women’s national hockey team to play in south korea, and south korea sent its women’s soccer team to play in north korea. north korea also sent a taekwondo team to the south.  the two nations marched together in the opening ceremony at the 2000 and 2004 summer olympics. south korean officials have held open that possibility for the winter games.  south korean officials have also strenuously sought to play down security concerns ahead of the 2018 games, which will be held in pyeongchang, south korea, only about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates north and south.  “these worries are understandable,” choi moon-soon, governor of the south korean province where the olympics will take place, told reporters last year. but, referring to north korea, he added, “if they participate in the event, that threat disappears.”            image     the north korean pairs figure skating team of ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik relax and celebrate at the kiss and cry zone in eissportzentrum, oberstdorf last september.   credit  jun michael park for the new york times         it is not known whether kim jong-un had any plans to disrupt the pyeongchang games, but olympic insiders have said the presence of north korean athletes would allow them to rest more easily.        last week, at the united states figure skating championships, david raith, executive director of u.s. figure skating, said he welcomed north korea’s presence at the olympics.  “we’re hoping they’re there,” mr. raith said. “it would be the safest place in the world.”  north korea missed a deadline in late october to officially enter its pairs team into the olympics. and it does not yet appear to have made such a request, alexander lakernik, a russian who is vice president of the international skating union, said in a telephone interview on tuesday.  but adding the north koreans to the olympic pairs competition would be a simple procedure. and the i.o.c. has said it would keep the doors open to north korea’s participation for as long as possible. the olympic committee has also broached the idea of offering north korea wild-card entries in some nordic skiing sports and short-track speedskating.  discussions have been underway about the pairs team, mr. lakernik said, and given the special circumstances, “there could be an exception made; but first we need an application.”  while north korea has won 16 gold medals in the summer games, in such sports as weight lifting, wrestling and boxing, it is not a power in the more expensive winter sports. north korea did not participate in the 2014 winter games in sochi, russia. its officials have recently complained that tightened sanctions against the country have made it difficult to obtain some sports equipment.  in general, north korea has not appeared to follow the model of the former soviet union and east germany, which were both winter sports powers and used gold medals for propaganda purposes. but experts see participation in these games as an attempt by mr. kim to get sanctions eased and to reduce the chances of american military action.        “sports diplomacy is a sexy affair,” said lee sung-yoon, a korea expert at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university. “pyongyang has all the reason to jazz up the winter olympiad and be the center of attention.”  purely in skating terms, mr. marcotte, the coach said, the north koreans appear to be mirroring the chinese model of attempting to build pairs teams to an elite international level.  at the 2006 and 2010 winter olympics, chinese pairs won two of the three available medals and are among the favorites to win gold at the 2018 games. ryom and kim possess some of the dynamism seen in chinese pairs and also some of the classic, balletic style of russian skaters. there is western influence in their routines as well. they perform their short program to an instrumental version of the beatles’ “a day in the life.”  while qualifying for the 2018 games at a competition in germany in september, the skaters spoke several times with reporters and seemed relatively open. both ryom and kim are listed as students. both live in pyongyang, the north korean capital, where loyalists to the kim jong-un regime are permitted to reside.  “i want to continue to improve until i become world champion,” ryom said at the time.  one subject was off limits: the olympics, because no decision had yet been made about north korea’s participation.  and there seemed to be every attempt to avoid politics.  neither skater, for instance, wore pins commonly worn by north koreans that depict kim il-sung and kim jong-il, kim jong-un’s grandfather and father, who preceded him as the country’s dynastic rulers. and both skaters neglected to praise kim jong-un for their success, another common practice for north korean athletes.  mr. marcotte, the coach, said that all his interactions with the skaters had been about “sports, sports, sports.”        and while their performance at the olympics would carry broader meaning for many, he said, the skaters would most likely feel only the pressure that every skater feels — to perform at their best.  “they want to show the world that they’re a good team,” mr. marcotte said.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — ester ledecka warded off the late afternoon cold on saturday in a czech republic team jacket that was white on one side and gold on the other. it could be worn either way, which made it as versatile as ledecka, who made history saturday with her victory in the women’s snowboarding parallel slalom.  ledecka, who had won an alpine skiing event, the women’s super-g, in an upset a week earlier, became the first woman to win a gold medal in two different sports in a single winter games.  not only did ledecka defeat selina joerg of germany in the final, she also nudged out  jorien ter mors  of the netherlands, who had become the first woman to earn medals in different sports in a single olympics while ledecka waited to compete in snowboarding. ter mors earned gold in the 1,000 meters in long-track speedskating and added a bronze in the 3,000-meter relay in short-track.        “i was dreaming about this moment since i was a little child,” said ledecka, whose margin of victory in her six runs was at least four-tenths of a second. “a lot of people were telling me that it is not possible to do both sports and to be on a high level in both sports and today i proved it is possible.”            image     ledecka crossing the finish line ahead of selina joerg of germany. they finished with gold and silver respectively.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         ter mors and ledecka, who was the first woman to compete in snowboarding and skiing in the same olympics, nevertheless have upended the belief, propagated in modern-day youth sports in the united states and elsewhere, that early specialization is the one clear path to the olympic podium.  ter mors, 28, who also competed in the two sports at the 2014 sochi olympics, took up long-track skating as a cross-training exercise to improve her conditioning for short-track.  ledecka, 22, began skiing at age 2, tried snowboarding three years later, and loves both so much she said she never considered becoming a sports monogamist.  when coaches counseled her to choose one or the other, she held her ground. she remained resolute even when her snowboarding coach, justin reiter, expressed his concerns last fall that she might hurt her snowboarding gold medal prospects if she chose to also compete in alpine skiing.            image        ester ledecka of the czech republic on saturday.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         “i for sure want to win every race,” ledecka said. “but the first thing is to enjoy and have good fun with what i’m doing with my sports.”  ledecka’s road to pyeongchang contained no forks, just parallel tracks. with their distinct dnas, skiing and snowboarding are snow sports’ fraternal, sometimes rival, twins. being good at one does not mean the same in the other, as lindsey vonn, the three-time olympic medalist in alpine skiing, can readily attest. “i tried snowboarding once, and it did not go well,” she said.  vonn, 33, is heartened by the example that ledecka is setting. she said she became a serious skier at age 13 by default. vonn would like to be a multisport athlete, but her forays into tennis, figure skating, soccer and gymnastics were short-lived. “i’ve never really been good at anything but racing,” she said.  a bronze medalist in the super-g at the 2010 olympics, vonn finished tied for sixth in the event last week. she was 38-hundredths of a second behind ledecka, who came into the event ranked 43rd in the world cup standings. ledecka, racing in the 26th position, edged the defending olympic champion, austria’s anna veith, by a hundredth of a second, or roughly the length of a finger.            image        ester ledecka (7) of the czech republic, jumping on the medal stand after winning gold alongside silver medalist selina joerg (16) of germany and bronze medalist ramona theresia hofmeister, also of germany.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         after posting the fastest time in the downhill portion of the combined event five days later, vonn joked that her time had a chance to hold up since there were no snowboarders in the field.        “the millennials are raw and inclusive, and trying other sports is important to them, as it should be,” vonn said. “i think maybe ester can give them hope that competing and being successful in more than one sport is possible. i think she definitely will have a long-lasting impact.”  mikaela shiffrin, a three-time olympic medalist who races in each of the five alpine disciplines, called ledecka “an incredible example” for young athletes.  “she didn’t just specify alpine skiing in her sports repertoire when she was 8 years old because she wanted to be an olympic champion,” shiffrin said. “she was doing a lot of things. she can find the similarities between her sports and actually help build and improve with one sport off of the other.”            image        jorien ter mors of the netherlands became the first woman to medal in two sports at the same olympics, earning gold in long-track speedskating and bronze in a short-track relay.   credit  valdrin xhemaj/european pressphoto agency         yet despite mounting evidence of the benefits of delaying specializing in one sport, ledecka and ter mors might still be anomalies, whether it comes to women or men (the last man to earn medals in two sports at the same winter games was heikki hasu of finland, in cross-country skiing and nordic combined, in 1952.)  evidence abounds that athletes should not specialize until the teenage years, to minimize the risk of overuse injuries and emotional burnout. felix mcgrath, a 1988 united states olympian in alpine skiing, was a four-sport athlete in high school.  “i love the fact that ester is a multisport athlete,” mcgrath said in an email from norway, where he lives and coaches skiing. “i have many problems with what is going on with youth sports in general. in norway and the u.s.a., specializing in one sport at a very young age — before 13 — has become common.”        mcgrath played soccer, tennis and golf during skiing’s off-season to maintain his connection to nature and to his fitness.            image        ester ledecka, center, stunned the favorites to win the super-g at the pyeongchang games.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         shiffrin sees other, less obvious benefits to ledecka’s dual track. she spoke of the jaw-dropping lines that ledecka carves on alpine courses, a knack that ledecka’s snowboarding coach, reiter, attributes to her experience maneuvering on a snowboard, which, because it has no steadying or stabilizing poles, requires seeing a mountain in a more imaginative way.  shiffrin, 22, recalled a downhill training run in lake louise, alberta, in november. ledecka recorded the fastest time, she said, and “everybody stopped and jaws dropped, like that run isn’t supposed to be skied that way.”  “it made everybody think about how much better we could all ski the course,” shiffrin added.  if there is a lesson to be learned from ledecka’s success here, reiter said, it is that the drive to specialize early, the better to achieve fame and fortune in sport, “should be redefined.”  michael trapp, an american who trains with ledecka in colorado, said her passion, and persistence, more than her talent or versatility, is what sets her apart. “she’s the hardest-working athlete i’ve ever met,” trapp said, adding that she will train in any conditions “and if she doesn’t come out with the fastest runs she’s mad about it. she acts like every day is a race day.”  trapp, 29, started out in all five snowboarding disciplines but was encouraged by his coaches to choose freestyle or racing. if he were a young child now, he might be inspired by ledecka’s example “to try more disciplines and stick with more disciplines,” trapp said. “just with her and her resilience to say, ‘no, i want to do what i want to do.’ that’s kind of her motto.”        the evolution of sports is driven by athletes whose unique vision opens everyone else’s eyes to what is possible. ledecka is a throwback outlier, someone whose refusal to specialize has a back-to-the-future feel — and appeal. shiffrin watched ledecka’s super-g run and knew she was seeing something special.  “i was screaming and crying when she came down and won that gold,” she said. shiffrin added with a laugh, “i thought this sport was hard, but apparently not.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — technically, russia did not win its first gold medal at these winter olympics on friday.  strictly speaking, alina zagitova, the 15-year-old victor in women’s figure skating, competed as a neutral “olympic athlete from russia.” at  a medal ceremony later friday , she watched the five-ringed olympic flag being raised instead of the russian flag and heard the olympic hymn played instead of the russian anthem.  but a nominal banning of russia from the olympics for operating a systematic doping scheme at the 2014 winter games in sochi was more of a semantic prohibition than a complete ban. one hundred sixty-nine russian athletes were permitted to compete here. and there was no question which country zagitova represented in winning gold with a score of 239.57 points as fans chanted her name and waved the russian tricolor.            image     alina zagitova during the free skate.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         her friend and training partner, evgenia medvedeva, took the silver medal with 238.26 points while skating as tolstoy’s tragic anna karenina. (kaetlyn osmond of canada won the bronze with 231.02 points, while no american placed higher than ninth out of 24 competitors, the worst collective finish by american women at the olympics.)        before the medal ceremony, zagitova declined to say whether she would be disappointed not to see the russian flag, but medvedeva said: “it doesn’t matter what the circumstances are. people know who we are. today, we proved ourselves here.”  a two-time world champion and consensus favorite to win gold before she broke a bone in her right foot last fall, medvedeva was forced to confront a sobering reality on friday at age 18: experience and artistry and expressiveness did not prevail over mathematics.  zagitova became the second-youngest women’s skater to win olympic gold with a program of shrewd design, remarkable stamina, precise jumping and youthful certainty. what she lacked in the full elegance that comes with maturity, zagitova compensated for with a keen understanding of skating’s current rules.            what if dorothy hamill, tara lipinski and yuna kim competed in these olympics?  we scored previous olympic figure skating champions using the current judging system. see how they compared with the new women’s gold medalist, alina zagitova.           image        medvedeva celebrating after winning the silver medal.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         in her balletic “don quixote” routine, she landed all 11 of her jumps in the second half of her four-minute free skate, compared to eight for medvedeva. this is known as back loading, and is meant to gobble up a 10 percent bonus awarded for each jump beyond the halfway point of a routine, as skaters’ legs begin to tire.  with calm under pressure and endurance gained from her strenuous training, zagitova placed a triple loop worth 5.65 points onto her second triple lutz, rescuing a combination jump that she could not complete after a heavy landing on her first lutz.  some find the beginning of zagitova’s routine — limited to spins, footwork and choreography — to be a tedious preamble. zagitova defended the design of the routine, saying, “it captivates the audience and makes them watch to the very end.”  a year ago, zagitova was the world junior champion, while medvedeva was the senior world champion favored to win olympic gold. then medvedeva broke a bone in her right foot last fall, missed training time and two important competitions and perhaps never fully regaining her stamina.            image        evgenia medvedeva of russia, a two-time world champion and favorite to win gold before she broke a bone in her right foot last fall, took the silver medal.   credit  james hill for the new york times         zagitova at the same time came into her own, defeating medvedeva at the european championships last month and now at the olympics.        “it’s life and it’s a lesson,” medvedeva said of being surpassed by a younger skater. “every year, every moment, every day, every week, every month, we must become stronger.”  zagitova has sometimes clashed with eteri tutberidze, who coaches her and medvedeva in moscow. several years ago, zagitova admitted she trained indifferently and nearly quit. but now she skates with a seriousness of purpose and a whispery inevitability. at practice on thursday, zagitova landed five triple jumps in a matter of seconds.  the skating world saw a similar olympic performance 20 years ago.  at the 1998 winter games, michelle kwan of the united states was widely favored to win a gold medal. but tara lipinski, then 15, entered those olympics as the world champion and skated with a technical mastery and joyous inevitability while kwan displayed the slightest caution. lipinski won and remains the youngest olympic champion by a few weeks at a comparable age to zagitova.            image        mirai nagasu of the united states finished 10th.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “she was literally a junior last year; it’s even hard for me to understand that,” lipinski said of zagitova. “what sets her apart is she has this fearlessness and the technical brilliance. i think she knows in a confident way that she’s the best.”  women’s skating in the united states — once dominant — continues to edge toward irrelevance at major international competitions. bradie tennell finished ninth, mirai nagasu was 10th and karen chen 11th.  no american woman has won an olympic medal since 2006 and only one has won a medal at the annual world championships. lipinski has criticized american officials for not adjusting to the current scoring system, which rewards the most difficult jumps.        george rossano, the editor of the website ice skating international, said, “the timeline for developing u.s. skaters is four years slower than the rest of the world.”            image        bradie tennell of the united states after completing her free skate routine.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         if a skater does not have triple-triple combination jumps by age 14, he said, “you’ve missed the boat to be a world-level competitor.”  the russians were behind, too, once.  during the soviet era, women’s skating produced only a single olympic bronze medal. the prevailing theory is that the top skaters were placed into pairs, an event which the soviets and russians long dominated until recent games.  but friday’s victory by zagitova was the second consecutive gold medal won by russian women, who operate in a centralized training system in which the top skaters challenge each other daily in practice.  after the soviet union fell, a number of rinks closed and some top coaches moved to the united states. but there are dozens of rinks in moscow now, some private, some state-operated. many of the top women’s skaters are funneled to tutberidze.            image        zagitova celebrating after her gold medal-winning performance.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “i would say that the girl who is beyond the top 10 is just as strong as the top three in the world,” tutberidze said in an interview in moscow in october.  according to evgeni plushenko, the 2006 men’s olympic champion who now has a skating club in moscow, there are about 15 russian girls who can land four-revolution jumps. at a competition in russia this week, one of tutberidze’s junior skaters, alexandra trusova, 13, boldly attempted two quads in her routine, landing a quad salchow and falling on a quad toe.  russia is not without its own issues, including the health of its young stars.  adelina sotnikova, the 2014 olympic champion at age 17, is not competing this season because of an injury. yulia lipnitskaya, who won gold at 15 in the team competition in 2014, has retired after battling anorexia. medvedeva’s olympic season was disrupted by the broken bone in her foot.  “it is a concern,” alexander lakernik, a russian who is vice president of the international skating union, said in a recent interview.  but it is a concern for another day. for now, russia is celebrating its first champion at these olympics. officially, as a team, its athletes are stateless, competing under a neutral flag. but a gold medal is still a gold medal.

       " 'gangneung, south korea — facing enormous pressure and scrutiny, north korea’s only elite athletes at these winter olympics delivered the best performance of their career on wednesday in pairs figure skating, helping to enliven a mostly subdued, half-empty arena.  the skaters, ryom tae-ok, 19, and kim ju-sik, 25, have zero chance for a medal. but that is not their measurement of success. their aim was to finish in the top 16 among 22 pairs in the short program, enabling them to participate in the long program on thursday. they accomplished their goal, finishing 11th in the short program with a personal best of 69.40 points from the judges.  ryom and kim come from the world’s most isolated nation, but, to a point, they appear open and expressive and embracing of outside influences. their choice of music wednesday was an instrumental version of the beatles’ “a day in the life,” as performed by the guitarist jeff beck, and the mostly somnolent crowd responded by clapping along during the song’s signature tempo change.  “we could really feel the power and energy of the korean people,” kim said before the skaters hurried through an interview area without stopping. still, they were clearly elated with their performance. ryom jumped into her coach’s arms as she left the ice, and the pair stood and pumped their fists when their score was announced.        the skaters are the only two of the 22 north korean athletes here to have qualified for these games by merit instead of wild-card entry. advancing to the medal round confirmed their arrival here via skill instead of largess.  “they’re not even close to medal contenders,” said bruno marcotte, a prominent canadian coach who has assisted the north koreans over the last year. “but i’m so happy they’re here because they belong here. they’re a world-class level team.”  the notion that ryom and kim have achieved some international success as individuals “in some respects sits uncomfortably alongside our image of north korea as the premier collectivist state in which the individual has no role or influence,” said john nilsson-wright, an east asia specialist at cambridge university and chatham house, a london-based think tank.            image     kim, left, and ryom at an event in germany in september. they are not medal contenders; their only hope is to finish high enough in the short program to qualify for the long program later in the games.   credit  jun michael park for the new york times         “this question that many of us grapple with when we look at north korea,” nilsson-wright said, “is to what extent as a sports person do you have the kind of autonomy and freedom and opportunity to express yourself as an individual in this very collectivist environment?”        south koreans have expressed  complicated feelings about north korea’s  participation in these olympics. but individual north korean athletes appear welcome — none more so than ryom and kim, who have been the subject of endless curiosity. ryom, with her ever-ready smile and red wool coat, might have been the most photographed athlete arriving at the games.  some have found in her a comparison to another north korean visitor, kim yo-jong — the sister of the country’s leader, kim jong-un — who attended the opening ceremony and charmed the south korea news media without ever speaking in public.  “north korea will probably use the performance of the figure skaters to boast how much north korea is getting international attention, just as kim yo-jong got the media following her and demonstrated to its people that north korea has reached a certain status in the world,” said kim kyung-sung, the president of the south and north korean sports exchange association.  at practice on tuesday, south korean fans paid nearly $30 and filled the lower section of the olympic ice arena, taking pictures with their smartphones and oohing, aahing and clapping as ryom and kim rehearsed their jumps, spins and lifts.  “i hope they will connect us together,” said cho da-in, 20, a student who also had a ticket to wednesday’s short program. “we are one blood.”  half an hour before wednesday’s competition began, a north korean news media contingent arrived, followed by a group of cheerleaders in their familiar red outfits, waving reunification flags.              when the pair took the ice to warm up, the cheerleaders waved north korean flags. a group of fans chanted the skaters’ names and held up a banner acknowledging them, while bearing another sign that said, “because one korea.”        han mahn-chul, 59, a spectator and an engineering researcher from seoul, the south korean capital, said he was impressed that the north koreans had qualified for the games in a sport like figure skating. “it is kind of a sport that advanced countries excel at,” han said. “that is the image it has. so the fact that a poor country like north korea has good skaters is amazing.”  ryom and kim are under tight control. when they arrive by bus at the olympic arena, a security detail flanks them, standing arm to arm, as they enter the building. but unlike the country’s cheerleaders, they are not being kept totally apart from outsiders.  the skaters waved jubilantly to the crowd before and after wednesday’s routine. and on tuesday, they walked without any monitors through an interview area, promising to speak more fully after the competition.  “there have been no inconveniences whatsoever, when it comes to life in the south area,” kim, who with ryom is competing for the first time in south korea, said on wednesday.  around other skaters, ryom and kim have shown a playful side. recently, in a waiting room before practice, the north koreans and their coach rolled their gloves into a ball and played an impromptu game of soccer to get their bodies limber.  on feb. 2, when ryom celebrated her birthday, kim kyu-eun, a south korean olympic pairs skater, gave her a gift of cosmetics. the north and south koreans trained together last summer with marcotte in montreal, alongside pairs teams from canada and the united states.            image        “they’re not even close to medal contenders,” said bruno marcotte, right, a prominent canadian coach who has assisted the north koreans over the last year. “but i’m so happy they’re here because they belong here. they’re a world-class- level team.”   credit  yonhap/european pressphoto agency         kim hyon-son, the north koreans’ primary coach, cooked kimchi for the south koreans in montreal. and meagan duhamel, a two-time world champion pairs skater and marcotte’s wife, took the north koreans shopping.  “everyone is really supportive of them,” said alex kam, the south korean skating partner of kim kyu-eun. “it’s good to see how sports brings everyone together without boundaries.”  in their few international competitions, ryom and kim have remained assured and composed, as they were on wednesday. they finished 15th at the 2017 world figure skating championships.  last september, they were self-possessed, if not flawless, in qualifying for the olympics at a competition in germany. there they traveled without security and sometimes left the rink unaccompanied by their coach or a team official.  in a sport that forbids political displays, ryom and kim on wednesday did not wear pins commonly worn by north koreans, depicting the former leaders kim il-sung and kim jong-il, the grandfather and father of the current leader.  both skaters are listed on their official bios as students. they live in pyongyang, the north korean capital, where the more privileged citizens live. at the qualifying event in germany, ryom declared, “i want to continue to improve until i become world champion.”        there is considerable room for improvement. for one thing, the north koreans, who seldom compete abroad, have found it challenging to train with three other olympic pairs on the ice at the same time. there have been a number of near collisions.  “one of the questions they ask me is, ‘what can we do to get better?’” marcotte, the coach, said. “my first answer is, they need to compete more often. the more they are exposed to competition, they will understand what they need to get their scores better and the more familiar they will be to the judges.”       ',\n",
       " 'london — katerina stefanidi, a greek pole-vaulter and former stanford university star, competed in only one event at the world track and field championships this month. she won the gold.  but when she and her husband, mitchell krier, boarded their plane out of london on friday, they left with two medals in their baggage: one for her, one for him.  krier is also stefanidi’s coach, and for the first time in the history of these championships,  coaches are receiving medals, too .  they are not getting their moment on the podium, at least not yet, and they are not receiving prize money of their own. but they are getting something tangible.        “i am for recognizing coaches,” stefanidi said friday. “i think it’s necessary, a good first step, and i think we can do better in the future.”            image     katerina stefanidi of greece celebrated her gold medal in the pole vault with her husband and coach, mitchell krier.   credit  kevin coombs/reuters         the olympic games do not award medals to coaches, but numerous professional events do, including soccer’s premier club competitions like the champions league. zinedine zidane has winner’s medals as a coach and a player for real madrid. but not every coach cherishes the spoils of victory, or defeat.  on tuesday, after manchester united’s manager, josé mourinho, received his runner-up medal when his club lost the uefa super cup final to real madrid, mourinho  handed the medal to a young boy  wearing a united shirt in the front row before leaving the stadium.  “sometimes when i win, i don’t keep the medals, so imagine when i lose,” mourinho said at the postmatch news conference.        in north america, super bowl and world series rings go not only to players but also to the coaching staff and often other support personnel.  but the olympic world has remained resistant to formalizing the concept until now, and there are hints of a trend. philippe starck, the french designer, has created prototype medals for the 2024 summer olympics, which is now  all but certain to be staged in paris .  the medals come in the usual gold, silver and bronze, but can be divided into four parts, allowing the athlete, if he or she wishes, to give sections to others. coaches would presumably be high on the priority list.          “now more than ever, we don’t win alone,” starck said in  a video  posted by the paris 2024 bid organization. “this is a really good reward for team spirit.”  renaud lavillenie, the french men’s pole-vaulter and world-record holder, provided confirmation that the demand is there by draping his own bronze medal from these championships around his sleeping 4-week-old daughter, iris, and  posting the photo on twitter  with the caption “the reason for my happiness.”          the united states olympic committee already has a medal ceremony to honor its olympic and paralympic coaches. the medal was established before the 2008 games in beijing, and the u.s.o.c. calls it the  order of ikkos , named for the first recorded olympic coach in ancient greece (he coached the pentathlon long before it went modern).        medal-winning athletes from the united states may acknowledge one coach, and the u.s.o.c. ceremonies traditionally take place at usa house. the medals awarded are not official olympic medals.  the coaches’ medals awarded at the world track championships in london are official, coming directly from the organizers. they are a smaller version of the medals presented to the athletes, and are made of brass.  “it looks the exact same, just mini; it probably should be bigger,” said christian coleman, the american silver medalist in the men’s 100 meters.  coleman, competing in his first world championships, said he was unaware of the decision to award coaches medals but happily handed it to his coach, tim hall, after he was presented with it after his medal ceremony last sunday.  “he said, ‘coach, this one is for you,’ and i was like, ‘wait, what?’” hall said. “it was an interesting twist, and it was very appreciated. i will cherish it for a long time. it’s his first international medal, and it’s mine as well.”  it will likely not be coleman’s or hall’s last in london; coleman and the united states 4x100-meter relay team are heavily favored to finish among the top three on saturday night, when coleman will get the chance to beat usain bolt of jamaica for the third time in three races in bolt’s farewell meet.        “i mean, that would be pretty special, pretty crazy actually,” coleman said.  other coaches are already guaranteed multiple medals here. edrick floréal’s hurdlers are having quite a meet, with omar mcleod of jamaica winning gold in the men’s 110 hurdles and kori carter of the united states winning gold in the women’s 400 hurdles. floréal also coaches keni harrison, the world-record holder in the women’s 100 hurdles, who hit the first hurdle in her semifinal friday night but recovered to squeak into the final as the last qualifier.  “if you think about it, how many athletes would reach a medal stand without a coach?” floréal said. “the good ones are really life coaches. it’s not just running around teaching how to hurdle or do stride patterns.”  but while floréal said he appreciated the gesture by the london organizing committee and track and field’s governing body, the international association of athletics federations, he still felt some of its priorities were not in order.  “i think there’s an underlying slap in the face for coaches in that something as simple as getting access to the warm-up track to talk to an athlete means you have to jump through 9,000 hoops and get a pass and then pass it on to someone else when you’re done,” he said. “meanwhile, it seems like all the agents are getting a pass from the i.a.a.f. its like the agents are more valued than the people actually getting athletes to perform. there has to be a shift. i think it’s senseless.”  there is also the argument, not unreasonable in light of track and field’s long history of doping violations, that giving medals to coaches only means there will be two to return instead of one after an infraction. should coaches be so honored considering the role some have played in some of the sport’s biggest scandals? (see trevor graham, former coach to marion jones and justin gatlin.)  “you don’t want to treat everybody as an inmate because a bunch of people are thieves,” floréal said. “you put the law in place to punish criminals, but i think coaches should be given the benefit of the doubt.”  while stefanidi said she supported recognizing coaches, she said that if the i.a.a.f. continued the practice there should be an attempt to make the presentation more formal. now, she said, it feels like an afterthought to be handed the coach’s medal away from the spotlight.        “to get a medal from some random person in some room where you’re trying to get your pass and go, it’s not emotional enough,” she said.  her suggestion: allow coaches on the podium after the national anthem to spend a moment with their athletes, when they can receive their coaches’ medals and be recognized publicly. “it would only add a minute or so to the ceremony, and i think it would mean a lot more,” she said.  but other athletes in london seemed delighted with the new state of affairs. jenny simpson, the american 1,500-meter runner who won a silver medal here against a deep and daunting field, gave her coach, heather burroughs, a huge hug shortly after the race, shouting, “i did everything you said!”  she then raced off to do more interviews, only to return at full speed a few minutes later.  “heather! heather!” simpson shouted. “you get a medal! did you know that?”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — when kikkan randall and marit bjorgen shared the olympic podium after the women’s team sprint freestyle, it was a significant moment for their sport. it was also a great moment for mothers.  first the significance. randall, 35, and her teammate jessie diggins  became the first american cross-country  skiers to win a gold medal, and the first from the united states to get any kind of medal at the olympics since bill koch won silver in 1976. and norway’s bjorgen, 37, won bronze to become the most decorated winter athlete, with 14 olympic medals, including five in pyeongchang. (after the winning the 30-kilometer race sunday, she finished the games with two gold, a silver and two bronze.)  both women are also relatively new mothers. randall’s son, breck, will be 2 in april. she is the only mother on team u.s.a., which has 20 fathers. bjorgen’s son, marius, turned 2 in december.  motherhood presents a challenge for any woman trying to juggle work and family, but it is an intense physical and logistical challenge for elite cross-country skiers — several hours a day of grueling training, extra sleep requirements and a brutal travel schedule across six or seven european countries from november through april.        women’s cross-country skiing experienced something of a baby boom about two years ago. seven elite ski racers on the world cup circuit, including bjorgen and randall, have toddlers now — and all had babies within about six months of one another in late 2015 and in 2016.            image     randall, trying to pass another skier at the alpensia cross-country centre, has tried to balance training and motherhood.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         it’s not a coincidence that the top women in the sport gave birth in the same window. with world championships in odd-numbered years and an olympics every fourth even-numbered year, 2016 was essentially a gap year in cross-country racing — a year without either international event. which made it a good time to start a family.  after their pregnancies, randall and her fellow competitors shared parenting advice about sleep training and getting back into shape. it seems to have worked. two of the women ended up on top of an olympic podium at these games and two more came close.  they also worked together to persuade the international ski federation to support them. randall and finland’s aino-kaisa saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms — stocked with diapers and toys — that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.        “men can have families, and they don’t ever have to miss a single race,” said randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. “knowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. it’s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.”  while those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in europe and didn’t face the same challenges randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. for randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.  their buy-in was never in doubt. randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. the goal was for randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. it helped that her husband, jeff ellis, a former canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the international ski federation. both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.            image        marit bjorgen of norway celebrated with her son, marius, after her victory in the women’s cross-country skiathlon during the 2017 nordic world ski championships.   credit  matthias hangst/getty images         “we made this deal where i wanted to be as much a part of the team as i could, but i didn’t want to be disruptive to the athletes,” randall said. “kids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.”  after talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules — sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.  there were bumps in the road. it took a month for breck to adjust to the time difference in europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. and it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. “there was a lot of gear,” randall said.        the toughest part was dividing her time between the needs of her family and her own desire to be with her team. “how do i be the best mom and best athlete? that part i hadn’t anticipated,” she said.  her teammate diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn’t always be ideal. sometimes the americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in park city, utah.  but diggins said the team didn’t want randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. “women shouldn’t have to choose,” diggins said. “this team only works when everyone buys in.”            image        randall and jessie diggins, right, celebrated after winning the team sprint, the first olympic gold for the united states in cross-country skiing.   credit  lars baron/getty images         and there were benefits to having breck along for the ride, said sadie bjornsen, another team member. bjornsen, who calls herself a “sucker for kids,” said playing with breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.  “sometimes i will come in after a race and be bummed out about how i’ve done, and i’ll just go over and hug breck, and it will make me feel better,” she said.  randall, who plans to retire after this olympics, recently won election to the international olympic committee athletes’ commission. she hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other olympic families.        in the end, she did not bring her son to the olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. instead, breck stayed in toronto with her husband’s parents, and the separation was painful, said randall. she said she wanted to work with the i.o.c. to create affordable housing for family members at future olympics.  she hopes that seeing women like herself and bjorgen on the olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn’t have to choose between an olympic medal and motherhood. in fact, she asserted, the two can work well together. she recalled sharing a moment with bjorgen when they were each presented a stuffed white soohorang tiger, the olympic mascot, during the podium ceremony. they looked at each other with a knowing laugh.  “i said, ‘well, this is for breck,’ and she said, ‘this is for marius.’ ”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — norway has one of the smallest men’s alpine teams on the world cup circuit, and only about 2.5 million men in the country to build a team from. and yet the norwegian skiers are dominating the olympics again.  aksel lund svindal and kjetil jansrud won gold and silver in the downhill here on thursday. norway has three racers in the top four of the  current world cup overall standings , and they are among the favorites to take home more olympic hardware before these games are through.  in an era in which every world-class athlete seems fixated on personal brand-building and competing for the most facebook likes and twitter followers, the norwegians embrace an altogether different approach to success. it is a contrarian mix of humility, egalitarianism and basic respect — plus sharing an absurd amount of meals over the course of a schedule that has them spending roughly 250 days together every year.  they get along so well and feel so strongly about collegiality that they even share beds sometimes.  “we believe there is no good explanation or justification for why you have to be a jerk to be a good athlete,” jansrud, the defending olympic super-g champion, said. “so we just won’t have that kind of thing on our team. you have to get along with everyone.”        in all, there are five time-honored, if unconventional, team dictums that they insist account for the outsize number of championships norway’s team has won the past two decades.            image     warming up before a race in italy in december. &ldquo;there are no rookies and no champions on the team,&rdquo; said aleksander aamodt kilde. &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all equals.&rdquo;   credit  christopher frankum/norwegian ski federation         no. 1, as jansrud mentioned, is the prohibition on jerks, a variation on a rule that uses a stronger word made famous by robert i. sutton’s  best-selling book  on leadership.  a second rule is that there is no class structure, even though jansrud and his veteran teammate svindal have combined to win 18 olympic and world championship medals as of nightfall thursday.  “when i joined the team i was just a teenager who still had a poster of aksel on my bedroom wall because he was a national hero,” aleksander aamodt kilde, 25, said.        on his first day with the team, kilde went to the team dinner — the norwegians always try to eat together — and discovered he was seated at the head of the table.  “there are no rookies and no champions on the team,” said kilde, now ranked 13th in the world cup standings and one of six norwegians in the top 30. “we’re all equals.”  another team maxim: the social fabric of the group is paramount.  “we have a saying,” svindal said. “there is almost no skill or ability you can have that is so good it allows you to ruin the social qualities of the team.”            image        norway’s team might be small compared with other european powers, but it consistently finds its way to the podium in major competitions.   credit  lisi niesner/european pressphoto agency         svindal explained the social quality of the team was essential because some days their training runs might last only two minutes — if that’s the only fun you have every day, you’re going to hate your job.  “across 250 days together, your life off the snow has to be really good,” he said.  along those lines, there is another team canon.  “we say that you talk to each other, not about each other,” lars maeland, the team’s strength and conditioning coach, said.        finally, there is one overriding, hard-and-fast team rule:  friday night is taco night.  eating tacos on friday nights is a national tradition in norway. wherever the norwegian men’s alpine team is in its rolling-stone existence — parts of every summer are spent on mountains in the southern hemisphere — the entire team gathers on fridays. the taco-prep duties rotate through the group. if possible, girlfriends and wives attend as well.  “that might be another, more unofficial, rule,” maeland said. “our girlfriends are also good friends.”  so, yes, the norwegian men’s team, which is about a dozen racers — or roughly one-third as many skiers as there are on some of the large european teams — is a close-knit group that gets along.            image        kjetil andre aamodt, left, and lasse kjus, who combined to win 36 olympic and world championship medals from 1992 to 2004, are credited with creating the norwegian team&rsquo;s culture.   credit  eric drape/associated press         but what does team bonding really have to do with skiing fast? team members are actually competing against one another in an individual sport; there is no team score at the end of each race. also, plenty of skiers have had success with little involvement with a national team.  jansrud, a gold medal contender at the pyeongchang games in the super-g, alpine combined and downhill events, insisted that everyone’s getting along leads to good results.  “there are no secrets in terms of individual tactics or techniques on the team; we share everything we know,” he said.        also, since ski racing is an unforgiving sport, with just one winner in each race, winning cannot be the only source of happiness, or else losing passion for the sport is inevitable. “if you have teammates who consistently lift you up, then the environment will make you happy,” jansrud said. “you’ll work harder and stay motivated. you’re giving yourself your best chance to win.”  putting team togetherness first was a concept passed down by past norwegian alpine luminaries like lasse kjus and kjetil andre aamodt, who combined to win 36 olympic and world championship medals from 1992 to 2004.  svindal, who joined the norwegian world cup team directly from the national junior program more than a decade ago, recalled how kjus and aamodt pulled him aside shortly after his promotion to explain that the team would always be his home.              “they told me, ‘this isn’t an n.b.a. team or something like that — you can’t be traded or sold to another team,’” svindal said. “we’re all here for life. those two guys created a culture of unity, and all we had to do was preserve it.”  but the togetherness extends in ways that would be wholly unfamiliar to an n.b.a. team. on the road, the racers — national sporting celebrities in norway — not only share hotel rooms, they sometimes share hotel beds.  “we don’t often stay in five-star hotels, and single rooms are very rare unless we’re traveling with an odd number of athletes,” said leif kristian nestvold-haugen, who has been on the team for about a decade. “and sometimes our rooms will have two double beds or just one queen bed. so then it’s two guys in the same bed. we don’t really think it’s a big deal.”        visualize, if you can, stephen curry and kevin durant sharing a hotel room on the road — let alone a bed.  shrugging his shoulders with a grin, nestvold-haugen agreed that was unlikely.  “maybe that’s another part of our system that forces people on the team to get along,” he said.  still, everything is not always entirely peaceable.  around the dinner table, it’s a group of alpha males who all want to be the best and think they know the answer to all kinds of things, from skiing to politics to economics, said nestvold-haugen, who is ranked 23rd in the world cup standings. “we don’t actually have a clue about those things, but we debate them anyway and we disagree,” he added. “but it never goes farther than that.”  from may to august, the team — en masse — usually conducts the bulk of its off-season strength and conditioning training together in the oslo area. other ski teams — the americans come to mind — scatter in the off-season, except for short periods spent at the team’s headquarters in utah.  for parts of two years beginning in 2016, there was a kerfuffle that tested the norwegian team’s noted harmony. henrik kristoffersen, a 23-year-old whose impressive results this season will make him a top contender in the slalom and giant slalom, tangled with norway’s national federation in a battle over an individual sponsorship agreement. in each season, kristoffersen eventually joined the team and signed an agreement to abide by its regulations.  those protocols do not officially include things like contributing positively to the social fabric or participating in taco fridays.        “but definitely, everyone understands those rules,” said svindal, the 35-year-old team elder.  that seems to be working.  heading into the downhill, the norwegians had won four silver medals and a bronze in the last six olympic downhill races but never the top prize in the sport’s most esteemed olympic race. then came thursday,  a near-perfect team triumph .  “i just wanted to win,” svindal said thursday afternoon as he sat next to jansrud at the postrace news conference. “and i know he wanted to win.”       ',\n",
       " 'essex, conn. — one of the fastest american marathon runners right now is a 29-year-old doctor in rural connecticut who doesn’t have a coach, doesn’t have a sponsor and doesn’t run with a watch. he trains alone, as long as feels right, with “only the trees for teammates,” he says. in the past seven years he has raced 47 marathons, winning 19 of them.  “i just go as long as i can before my legs get too heavy and my head gets in a haze,” said chris zablocki, the best marathoner most elite marathoners have never heard of.  last year zablocki set the world record in the indoor marathon, a 211-lap ordeal around the 200 meter indoor track at the armory in new york city. he logged a time of 2 hours 21 minutes 48 seconds. it was his fifth marathon of the year, and his fifth victory, and it was only march. now he is returning to defend his title on saturday.  zablocki is the rare athlete who is able to pull off quality races in astounding quantities, emerging as a maverick of the american distance running scene. zablocki’s strategies are indisputably extreme: he once ran three marathons in three countries in three weekends, winning or medaling in all. and he keeps getting faster: he ran his best marathon ever last december, a 2:13:45. it was the 19th fastest time in the united states in 2017 — and his 11th marathon that year.        “you have guys who run as fast as chris, sometimes even with full-time jobs like him, but what’s extraordinary is the number of times he does it,” said jonathan gault, a staff writer at the leading running website letsrun.com and zablocki’s former teammate. “chris is the kind of competitor who’s always going to give absolutely everything he can, short of dying.”  zablocki has accomplished this success while on an improvised professional odyssey that has taken him around the world .  since graduating from dartmouth in 2010, zablocki has been: a high school teacher on an atoll in the marshall islands (where he led students in the first marathon completed by islanders in the nation’s history); a marine (until he failed to master the requisite synchronized heel pivots and pants blousing and dropped out after a month); a medical student in the caribbean island st. maarten (where he enrolled so he could start three weeks after he finished his postbaccalaureate instead of wasting time with an application cycle); and a student doctor doing rotations in chichester, britain (where he had his last training partner, who worked at a local condiment factory).  “chris is unlike anybody else i’ve met; he loves running for the sake of running but also has the ability to push his body to extreme limits,” said the british training partner, james baker, he works at a factory making mayonnaise. “he can go through the pain barrier, he has a special ability to recover quickly. and he is genuinely a nice guy.”            image     zablocki ran 211 laps around the 200-meter track at the armory in new york city last year in a world-record time.   credit  the armory         now zablocki lives at his parents’ home in essex, conn., while he waits to match for his medical residency next week. he’s hoping for a rural family medicine program in indiana, which he says he favors for the chance it affords him to drive a tractor and farm kale, his preferred nutritional supplement, in his spare time.        if most elite athletes devote themselves to preparing for one or two races a year, and make it a full-time job, zablocki is the quantity guy, running an almost unheard-of number of marathons for any speed, but also running them very, very fast. he does so on his own terms, balancing races with the demands of his medical career — after running his fastest time in california in december, he was back at the danbury hospital in connecticut at 7 the next morning. he says he studied on the plane. and he does it without having his approach dictated by companies. (the running company newton gives him free shoes, but otherwise, he says, “i am sponsored by the streets”). he instead supports himself with student loans for medical school, and finances his races through his race earnings (last year, they were $26,300, often paid in $100 increments).  but the pay-your-way approach has its limitations. while studying medicine in st. maarten in 2014, zablocki entered a marathon in florida. he booked a cheaper flight to a city 200 miles away, but forgot his drivers license for the drive. he stood next to the bus station at midnight with a sign requesting a ride, but received only offers for sex. after 2 a.m., a cab finally drove him across the state ($200), dropping him near the starting line two hours before the race, where zablocki lay in a daze but couldn’t sleep. he won the race anyway ($500).  zablocki’s aptitude for pushing limits began early. he walked onto the cross country team at dartmouth his freshman year and finished last on the junior varsity team in its first race. majoring in history with an emphasis on conflict studies in medieval and roman eras, he applied his lessons to racing.  “battles are like a racecourse, with mud spraying everywhere,” he said. “and the only option is to win.”  he was inspired by his teammates who would go on to be elite runners, like ben true, who went on to set the american 5-kilometer road record, and alexi pappas, who competed for greece in the 2016 summer olympics. his hero was alumni bob kempainen,  who won the 1996 olympic marathon trial while throwing up  and is now a critical-care doctor.  even then, his willingness to push the boundaries of conventional training regimens set him apart. jason lyon, who walked onto the cross country team with zablocki at dartmouth, recalled canoeing next to him as he swam a mile downstream for a second daily workout.            image        zablocki ran cross country at dartmouth.   credit  matt risley/dartmouth athletics         “i told him that it was going to take him much longer to get back given the current but he didn’t seem to care,” said lyon. “sure enough, when he turned around he spent about a half-hour trying to get back to the dock but hadn’t made much progress. i eventually had to drag him out of the water like a little puppy and toss him in the canoe.”        by his junior year, zablocki had made varsity, navigating a team dynamic that reveled in taking an endurance approach to running and partying alike.  “i tried to follow the example of the teammates who were racing fast and not the ones who got into fights at frat houses and temporarily dismissed,” he said. “but it’s fun to see how far you can go.”  the lifestyle continued after college. in 2012, zablocki and his teammates ran the harpoon oktoberfest race, downing keystone light close to campus the night before. (“it’s the cheap beer they sell at the dartmouth liquor store,” zablocki clarified.) the morning of the race, zablocki accepted a dare to down a keystone “tall boy” — and then set the course record.  allison benton, who coached zablocki for eight months in 2015-2016 in britain tried to get him to scale back on his inclination to push every run to its maximum.  “chris is unique, unlike any other marathon runner i have worked with,” she said. “his ability to recover quickly after a high volume workout or race is exceptional and he uses this ability to do something apparently abnormal in racing so many marathons each year.  “the hardest thing in coaching chris is to help him to control this urge to push hard on a daily basis.”            image        “joining the marines sounded like an exciting thing to do,” zablocki said. “but it turned out, i couldn’t follow the rules. i was just bad.”   credit  christopher capozziello for the new york times         after graduating, he set out with some classmates to teach high school on jaluit atoll on the marshall islands, being assigned history, which came naturally, and chemistry, which did not.  “i told the principal that i got a 43 on my chemistry midterm in college and had to drop it, but the previous chemistry teacher had died the week i got there, and they told me, ‘you’re the best we’ve got.’”  he’d planned to retire from the sport, but a teammate wanted company. diabetes and obesity were a major problem on the island — the school’s physical education teacher was so overweight he was wheelchair-bound — so zablocki started taking anyone who was interested along with him on his runs, though they were often running barefoot over the painful crushed coral of the tarmac of the island’s airstrip.  the olympic committee took notice and volunteered to fly three students with zablocki to the marathon on one of the main islands, provided they proved themselves by finishing a 20-mile training run. they did. then zablocki paced them through the marathon in tropical heat: “they raced tough,” he said of them. “one didn’t say anything during the race even though both his big toenails fell off after.”  returning to the united states, zablocki spent just over a month in the marine corps. failing to master synchronized heel pivots of marching drills or proper blousing of his pants, he received the most chits of any of his classmates and was punished repeatedly.  “joining the marines sounded like an exciting thing to do,” he said. “but it turned out, i couldn’t follow the rules. i was just bad.”        his former teammate glenn randall put it another way: “chris showed up, set the record in the 3 mile run they have to do, but couldn’t march,” he said. “he can’t do the regular thing, but for the hardest thing, he’ll reliably be the best.”  he resigned and pivoted instead to medical school. and despite his looming defense of his world record, he’s most anxious about learning about his professional future next week.  “honestly, i’m hoping to get a residency and retire from running,” he said. “although looking back, i’ve tried to retire a few times. it just doesn’t work out.”       ',\n",
       " 'when simon schempp, a biathlete on the german olympic team, was training for the pyeongchang games, he often capped a hard day on the trail with a bottle of nonalcoholic beer. he enjoys the taste of beer like most germans, who drink more of it per capita than the people of almost any other nation. but he drank the nonalcoholic variety for more than just the flavor.  “it’s a really good drink directly after training or after competition,” said schempp, who won a silver medal in the 15-kilometer mass start event on sunday.  schempp’s sober assessment is popular in germany. while most people see nonalcoholic beer as a responsible replacement for regular beer, germans often drink it in place of sports drinks after exercise. beer or gatorade? no contest.        johannes scherr, the doctor for the german olympic ski team, said nearly all of his athletes drink nonalcoholic beer during training. and the brewery krombacher has supplied 3,500 liters (about 1,000 gallons) of nonalcoholic beer to the athletes’ village so german athletes can enjoy it during competitions at the pyeongchang games, where germany is tied for the most gold medals.            image     the top three finishers at the 2017 berlin marathon were given medals and big nonalcoholic beers.   credit  christian behnke/erdinger weissbräu         german beer companies originally marketed nonalcoholic beer as the “car driver’s beer” after it was invented in east germany in 1973. a decade ago, scherr, who also teaches sports medicine at the technical university of munich, noticed that beer companies were beginning to pitch their nonalcoholic products to health-conscious consumers.  “a lot of companies tried to associate beer, especially nonalcoholic beer, and sports,” he said. “but there wasn’t any scientific background behind it.”  scherr conducted  a double-blind study , financed by a brewing company, in which he gave runners in the 2009 munich marathon nonalcoholic beer every day for three weeks before and two weeks after the race. these runners suffered significantly less inflammation and fewer upper respiratory infections after the race than runners who had been given a placebo.  “this was pretty surprising to us,” said scherr, who published the results in the peer-reviewed journal medicine &amp; science in sports &amp; exercise.        if nonalcoholic beer helped athletes recover more quickly from grueling workouts, then it could allow them to train harder. scherr credits the nonalcoholic beer’s salubrious effects to its high concentration of polyphenols, immune-boosting chemicals from the plants with which its brewed.            image        every runner who finished the berlin marathon last year was offered a nonalcoholic beer.   credit  christian behnke/erdinger weissbräu         “after that, we really had the proof: it’s really healthy and not only a marketing gag,” said holger eichele, the chief executive of the german brewers association. from 2011 to 2016, german consumption of nonalcoholic beer grew 43 percent even as overall beer consumption declined, according to euromonitor international. new brewing techniques helped to diversify and improve the flavor, and now there are more than 400 nonalcoholic beers on the market in germany. germans drink more nonalcoholic beer than any nation, except iran.  “it tastes good, and it’s good for the body,” linus strasser, an alpine skier from munich, said on sunday after finishing his second run in the men’s giant slalom. “alcohol-free wheat beer, for example, is extremely healthy. it’s isotonic. that’s why it’s good for us sports guys.”  many breweries market their nonalcoholic beers explicitly as sports drinks. the bavarian brewery erdinger, for instance, calls its nonalcoholic wheat beer “the isotonic thirst quencher for athletes” and advertises it with the motto, “100% performance. 100% regeneration.” heineken promotes its nonalcoholic beer heineken 0.0 with lines like, “there is no limit to what the human body can achieve,” and recently struck a deal to sell heineken 0.0 in the vending machines at mcfit fitness, germany’s largest chain of gyms. at most major german marathons, nonalcoholic beer is available to runners at the finish line. erdinger handed out 30,000 bottles at the berlin marathon last year.  sales have been helped by the fact that traditional sports beverages, like gatorade, are not particularly popular in germany. nonalcoholic beer has a lower sugar content compared with many sports drinks, and germans drank three times as much nonalcoholic beer as they did sports drinks in 2016.  moritz geisreiter, a german speedskater, said he drank nonalcoholic beer from the grocery store before switching to a specialized sports beverage designed by a nutritionist. “it’s a nice solution for someone who doesn’t want to pay dozens of euros a week for a nutrition drink,” he said last week at the olympic skating oval in gangneung, south korea.            image        simon schempp of germany won a silver medal in the 15-kilometer mass start biathlon event on sunday.   credit  sean m. haffey/getty images         scherr doesn’t prescribe nonalcoholic beer to the german olympic skiers. most of them are bavarian and drink it on their own. he usually recommends that athletes drink a nonalcoholic beer after exercise, but a 2016 study by chilean researchers in the peer-reviewed journal nutrients also found that nonalcoholic beer before a workout helped soccer players stay hydrated compared to regular beer and water. scherr also believes it benefits most endurance athletes and may be less helpful in sprint or strength-based competitions, where inflammation is less of a problem.  despite its demonstrated benefits, nonalcoholic beer has been slower to catch on with athletes from other countries. when the ethiopian runner guye adola finished second at last year’s berlin marathon, setting the record for the fastest-ever marathon debut, he did not take a sip from the enormous mug of erdinger nonalcoholic beer that was handed to him when he finished.  “i was scared that it might contain alcohol and i didn’t want to add to my fatigue,” he said in an email. “in our country, we don’t have such stuff at the finish line.”  of course, at the finish line, after months of training, many german athletes crave something with a kick — which is why krombacher also shipped 11,000 liters of regular beer to south korea.  “sometimes an alcoholic beer can also be good,” strasser said with a smile.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — chloe kim, the 17-year-old who outsoared her helpless rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe tuesday, was sitting near shaun white on the eve of the olympics, when a question about pressure was directed her way. kim, lined up on an auditorium stage with the american team, was, after all, expected to overwhelm the competition here, and maybe at several more games after this.  she shrugged the question away.  “i don’t really think about it as pressure,” she said. pressure is a byproduct of expectations, she added, and expectations mean that people believe in you.  white, 31 years old and the most famous rider in history, fielded deeper questions about his life and career. without much prompting, he kept returning to the concept of expectations and pressure. it was obviously on his mind, a constant companion for about 25 years now.  the years have taught him that the hardest trick is sustaining success when everyone expects it from you.        his audience was a room full of journalists, but it felt aimed, purposely or not, at an audience of one: kim.            image     kim’s father, jong jin kim, watching her compete. kim was born and raised in southern california.   credit  margaret cheatham williams/the new york times             image        kim’s mother, boran yun kim, during kim’s final run in which she scored 98.25 from the judges.   credit  margaret cheatham williams/the new york times         “it’s just kind of the mental mind-set of having won, and then having to win after winning, and win after winning after winning, you know?” white said, laughing. “it’s a great problem to have, but it’s finding that motivation, finding that drive.”  kim has been beating the competition for years, but on tuesday at phoenix snow park she fully revealed her talent and charisma to a broad audience. she dazzled from the start with a score of 93.75 on her first run, and no one came close to beating that mark. on her third and final run, with the gold medal clinched, she wanted to “one-up myself,” she said later. she did, with a victory lap that included her signature back-to-back 1080s, three spins off one wall of the pipe followed by three more on the other. that run scored 98.25 from the judges.        “i knew that if i went home with a gold medal knowing i could do better, i wasn’t going to be very satisfied,” kim said at the bottom of the pipe.  pressure? before that late-morning run, kim had logged on to twitter to tell her growing legion of fans that she was hungry.          “just trying to distract myself” to ease the nerves, she said.  the silver went to liu jiayu of china, with 89.75. arielle gold of the united states had a strong third run, scoring 85.75, to knock her countrywoman kelly clark out of the bronze medal position. clark, who scored 83.50 on her third run, finished fourth at her fifth olympic games — she also has a gold from 2002 and two bronze medals.  kim, born and raised in southern california as the daughter of south korean immigrants, was warmly adopted by fans from the host country. on a sunny morning, she received the biggest ovation when introduced before her first run, and when she reached the bottom with a clean run and a bright smile, she was greeted by the sound of cheers and cowbells.            image        kim had a score of 93.75 on her first run, and no competitor came close to beating that mark.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         at the end of the event, chased by mobs of reporters and fans pushing to get closer, she finally found her family. her eyes filled with tears as she hugged her father, jong jin kim, who introduced her to snowboarding — something he learned alongside her — when she was a toddler. during the competition, he held a wrinkled, handwritten sign that read “go chloe!” next to a big, red heart.        the next stop for kim is a higher stratosphere of celebrity. for americans, she seemed certain to become the big name and face to emerge from these olympics.  “this whole experience has been insane,” kim said. “you hear so much about the olympics, but actually being a part of it is a completely different story. i’m so fortunate to be able to go through all that, and share my story with the world. that has been amazing for me. and i’m really excited for the future.”            image        kim was greeted by her family including her mother, at the bottom of the pipe.   credit  margaret cheatham williams/the new york times         white knows all about that. kim’s rise is a strong echo of his. it will be his turn on wednesday to try to win gold. for the fourth time, he arrived as a favorite to win the olympic halfpipe competition, looking for his third gold medal. in 2014, he finished fourth.  he has grown from brash childhood icon, with all the fame that kim just boarded into, to elder statesman of a sport — a movement, really — now gliding into its next generation. the sight of him near kim felt like a mash-up of the past and the future. their competitions in the same venue one day apart feel like a swinging gate between yesterday and tomorrow.            how chloe kim won gold with a nearly perfect score in halfpipe  her gold-medal run included a trick that no other woman has landed in competition.       the comparisons are about more than celebrity. both grew up in southern california. both were immersed in skateboard culture early. both had parents who took them to the mountains to snowboard. both began to dominate halfpipe contests by the time they hit puberty.        kim stomped the competition in qualifying contests before the 2014 winter olympics, but she was too young to be eligible to compete in sochi. she has won the x games halfpipe competition in aspen, colo., three times, and also has a silver and bronze.  both white and kim soar past peers with a mix of fearlessness and acrobatics. unafraid of speed (perhaps from years on skateboards) or height, they routinely fly higher than others, giving them time to perform tricks most others have never landed or even tried.  after a solid first run on tuesday, kim went for back-to-back 1080s — she was the first woman to land two in a row in 2016 — on her second try, but fell. but on the third run, she tried again and landed both for an emphatic exclamation point.            image        arielle gold, left, had a strong third run, scoring 85.75, to earn bronze and join kim on the podium.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         both kim and white have significant social-media followings (though white’s fans number in the millions while kim has several hundred thousand). kim had about 15,000 twitter followers at the start of the day, but by the time the sun fell in south korea, she had roughly 150,000.  both have a wide spectrum of sponsors and teams of handlers — and complicated relationships with their competition. snowboarders generally consider their trade more a lifestyle than a vocation. camaraderie and an ambivalence toward winning contests permeate the culture.  white has long been a bit of an outsider among his peers, many of whom view his commercial appeal and embrace of fame with a mix of derision and jealousy. kim is a bit different; she dropped into an already established culture, and riders like clark became mentors and sister figures. but it is not hard to imagine a divide growing, as it did with white, between kim and her peers — the women she continues to leave behind in competition and commercialism.        but no one asked about intrasport tensions when white and kim were on stage together a few days ago. white talked about how much his focus changed when fame and fortune came his way as he prepared for his first winter olympics.  “i was 19, i had these huge contracts and deals and things, and my life was pretty much set, you know,” white said. “and then the motivation became just to solidify the fact that this is just who i am and what i do.”  white is a complex man — part athlete, part businessman, part cultural icon. he long ago shed his flying tomato nickname. his red hair is cut rather short, stylistically mussed, the vogue of someone who wants to play but also wants to be taken seriously.            image        shaun white competing at the pyeongchang winter olympics.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         he was sponsored by burton at age 7 and was a snowboarding and skateboarding icon by middle school. soon he was expected to win every competition he entered, from the x games to the olympics. from his earliest memories, he was expected to be the next big thing, he said.  “i was also teed up to be the next big failure,” he added.  all of this was said as kim sat within arm’s reach. white never mentioned her, and he didn’t seem to realize that he was talking about her — over and over — as he was talking about himself.  a reporter asked white about ayumu hirano, who was 15 at the 2014 winter olympics when he won a silver medal in the halfpipe for japan. by then, he was already being compared to white, heaped with big expectations.        “that’s a very tough position to be in,” white said. “i know, from being a young snowboarder myself.”  by then, kim had leaned forward and turned to listen.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — canada appears to be living up to its reputation for politeness.   an executive from the canadian olympic committee met on thursday with counterparts representing russian athletes at the winter games here and apologized over an episode that may not actually have involved a canadian.  at issue is an altercation that took place this week, when a russian coach said he had been verbally abused at a canteen in the olympic village about the participation of russian athletes.   tensions are running high  among athletes and officials over the presence in pyeongchang of more than 160 russians, who will be  allowed to participate  even though their country was banned in punishment for the systematic doping program at the 2014 event, hosted by sochi, russia.  the athletes will compete under the banner of “olympic athletes from russia.” the situation has been exacerbated by appeals by some russian athletes and officials to allow them to participate in the games after they had been barred by the international olympic committee over links to the doping program. a final group of 47  had their appeals rejected friday , just hours before the opening ceremony.        canadian officials said they were informed by the i.o.c. that the person who had engaged in the abusive behavior — whose identity remains unclear — may have been with their delegation, and the mere suggestion was enough for them to offer an apology.  “it was a simple discussion and it was o.k.,” said eric myles, the executive director for sport for the canadian olympic committee. “we said, ‘hey, if something happened we are sorry.’”  myles noted that canada had apologized even though it didn’t have many details and had been under no obligation to do so. “it’s an emotional time, there’s a lot of action going on internationally with all this situation, and when we heard about this situation, and honestly, it’s not clear,” he said. “i don’t know if it was a coach, athlete, was it really a canadian, honestly, we don’t know that.”  team leaders in the canadian delegation have been reminded about how they are expected to conduct themselves, myles said.  “we haven’t had anything since then,” he said.  the contrition seemed to satisfy stanislav pozdnyakov, the head of the russian delegation. “we got apologies and now everything is o.k.,” he said.        a cloud has hung over russian athletes for almost two years, after  the exposure of an elaborate scheme  that involved the surreptitious replacement of hundreds of tainted urine samples in sochi. at the summer games in rio de janeiro in 2016, some russian athletes were targeted by rivals angered by the revelations of widespread doping.  the russian swimmer yuliya efimova, who was allowed to compete in rio, later described her experience as “awful” and “a war.”  efimova was shunned by her rivals  and jeered by spectators on her way to two silver medals.  canadian officials have been among the most vocal about drug cheating. “there’s no place for doping in sport and we will do everything we can to constantly fight against doping,” said trisha smith, the head of the canadian olympic committee, at a news conference on thursday.  richard pound, a canadian who is the i.o.c.’s longest-serving member and the former head of the world anti-doping agency, attacked colleagues this week over their handling of russian doping, saying that the governing body had failed to act strongly enough.  “i believe that in the collective mind of a significant portion of the world, and among the athletes of the world, the i.o.c. has not only failed to protect athletes, but has made it possible for cheating athletes to prevail against the clean athletes,” pound said. “we talk more than we walk.”  pound said that athletes and the public “no longer have confidence that their interests are being protected. our commitment to both is in serious doubt. with respect, i don’t think we can talk our way out of this problem.”       ',\n",
       " 'eugene, ore. — to watch as chaunté lowe took her high jumps at the prefontaine classic here in late may was to see a great athlete with a busted wing. she was 33 and hobbled, her hamstring aching and ankle sprained. she limped away after each jump and soon enough was disqualified. it led me to wonder if we were watching this exuberant four-time olympian high jumper and reigning american record-holder aging in front of us.  in june, in sacramento, she failed to qualify for the united states team heading to the world championships in london next month.  if lowe’s athletic clock is ticking down, if she competed in her final olympics last summer in rio de janeiro, she can draw comfort in what happened in november. she was in her kitchen in florida, her three little children out of the house, going through her facebook notifications when a message popped up from a friend, the german high jumper ariane friedrich: “congratulations olympic bronze medalist!”        lowe gave a quizzical look, took the message for a joke and clicked on another message: “congratulations chaunte. so proud!”            image     lowe clearing the bar at the 2012 games in london, the third of her four olympics.   credit  matt dunham/associated press         this time she clicked on the embedded link. she read a news report: three olympians — two russians and a ukrainian — who had finished in front of her in the 2008 olympics in beijing failed retroactive doping tests. she had moved from sixth to third place.  she had become an olympic bronze medalist. it was her first medal. she felt herself beginning to dance.  “i screamed like someone was in my house trying to take away my cookies,” she said. “i was excited and relieved at the same time. ‘oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you are not a failure’!”  her reaction speaks to the volcanic pressures that elite athletes carry within. and her tardy medal speaks to the strange and sad world of modern doping, a battle between rogue chemists and medical detectives. the world anti-doping agency now holds blood and urine samples from olympic athletes for eight years, against the day that advances in detection allow for retests.            image        lowe, 33, in may at the prefontaine classic, where aches and injuries hobbled her.   credit  chris low for the new york times         the disqualifications from past olympics now run into the many dozens. in november alone, the international olympic committee stripped 10 medals from athletes found to have cheated in the 2008 olympics.  so justice arrives like a distant echo.  even as lowe danced about her house, calling friends, another realization dawned. she had missed her olympic moment. she watched in 2008 as a cheater stood on the podium with a national flag and accepted a medal that rightfully was lowe’s. (she has not received her bronze medal, as one of the athletes accused of doping has appealed the finding; even then, the process of retrieving the medal and forwarding it to lowe could take many months.)  “man, i wanted to get that feeling of being on a podium and the world is applauding your achievement,” she says. “i was robbed of that moment, and i am surprised to find myself feeling joy and struggling to keep my faith.”  she knows the shadow of doubt that athletes labor within, and the certainty that more disqualifications will deepen its hues. dirty athletes get caught and doubts arise about everyone. lowe has never had other than a clean test. until recently, she assumed doping was more the province of sprinters and weight lifters and long-distance runners.            image        lowe is the american record-holder in the high jump at 6 feet 8¾ inches.   credit  chris low for the new york times         all three of the disqualified high jumpers used turinabol, a steroid that builds lean muscle mass and endurance, which is particularly useful in long meets with multiple jumps. it also acts in concert to make other steroids more effective.        “to see that my sport was one of the dirtiest in that olympics changed my world,” lowe says. “it’s a really dark rabbit hole. i don’t want people to cast a shadow on my career.”  another american, derek miles, a pole-vaulter, also was awarded a belated bronze medal for the beijing olympics. miles has retired and works as an assistant track coach at the university of south dakota.  lowe had worked to make her peace with her lack of olympic medals. “i had the option to write my story as a success or a failure,” she says. “when i was 4 years old, i told my sister i would make it to the olympics. i’ve competed in four.”            image        lowe took advantage of physical therapy at the prefontaine meet. she has given thought to competing at the 2020 olympics.   credit  chris low for the new york times         her personal tale is more striking than that.  she came of age in paso robles, calif., in a family lashed by the storms of addiction. the electricity would get shut off one week, then the water. in sixth grade, she left for a track meet and returned to an empty house. where, she asked her mother, are my sisters? i sent them to live with their father, her mother replied. our house is getting foreclosed on.  “mom saw that our ship was sinking,” lowe says.  lowe slept with her mother in cheap motels and in the back seats of cars. (her father has spent most of his adult life in california’s prisons, also trapped by addictions.) when summer arrived, her mother packed chaunté off to live with an aunt. “my mother was embracing a camping lifestyle,” lowe says. “mom was off the grid.”  lowe thought a lot about her life and talked a lot with god that summer. in august, she told her mother that she had decided to live with her grandmother in riverside. she knew she needed stability. as a high school freshman, she told the track coach that she wanted to try the high jump. you have to beat out the juniors and seniors, he told her.        that was that, he figured.  she woke before dawn to practice — a habit she has never lost — and eventually outjumped the best in the nation. she sprinted, triple-jumped, hurdled and scored in the classroom, too. at georgia tech, she finished with a 4.0 grade-point average. her coach there, nat page, became a surrogate father. when she married mario lowe, page walked her down the aisle.            image        lowe has become a favorite of track crowds, with her high bounding steps and leaps, and her enthusiastic responses.   credit  jed jacobsohn/getty images         “believe me, i’m his daughter,” she says.  i spent an hour talking with lowe at the rio games last summer and another hour in may after the eugene competition, and i’m no closer now than i was then to decoding the how of this woman.  she and her husband have a daughter with asperger’s syndrome. there were two foreclosures, and for a while it seemed the quicksand of family fate was tugging at her ankles. she pulled free. she became a favorite of track crowds, with her high bounding steps and leaps, slithering up, up and over that bar. she lands and bounds to her feet, clapping, smiling, doing a little boogie.  she has a master’s degree and a career in financial planning. her athletic future holds a question mark for now. she has given thought to the 2020 games in tokyo. the body, however, is not an infinitely malleable instrument. she had tortured herself as never before in the four years leading to the rio olympics. and still she fell short, taking fourth place.  now she has her medal. she laughs, taken aback by the power of her obsessions and her life’s voyage. “i’ve graduated college, i’m a decent mother, and my husband and i are on 12 years of marriage and i’ve represented my country with integrity,” she says. “if i allow myself to write my own story, i’m a success.”  that was clear long before she read those facebook messages last november.

       " 'adolph kiefer, a celebrated swimming champion who won gold as a teenager at the 1936 berlin olympics and might well have become one of america’s greatest olympic champions if world war ii had not intervened, died on friday at his home in wadsworth, ill. he was 98.  the united states olympic committee reported his death on its  team usa website,  describing him as the oldest living united states olympic champion.  if the war denied kiefer a chance for more olympic gold — the 1940 and 1944 games were canceled because of world war ii — it nevertheless gave him, in his view, his greatest satisfaction. as a naval officer, appalled at the number of drowning deaths among american casualties, he helped improve swimming and lifesaving instruction for the navy.        his triumph in berlin seemed to presage a dominant olympic career. as kiefer took the gold, albion ross, who was in berlin covering the games for the new york times, wrote, “no one who saw today’s race could honestly deny that he had witnessed the greatest back-stroker that has ever swum.”              and kiefer continued to improve, reaching his peak about a decade later, when he was in his 20s. in an  npr program  about kiefer in 2008, the sportswriter frank deford said that if the war had not interrupted his career, “he’d be to the backstroke what pablo casals was to the cello.”  tall and good-looking, kiefer was courted by hollywood and drew comparisons to matinee idols. “he is a van johnson in pastel drawers, the greatest backstroke swimmer who ever lived,” the sports columnist red smith wrote.  kiefer went into business instead, and thrived.  sonny boy kiefer, as he was widely known, broke his first world record at the age of 15, and for 15 years he held every world backstroke mark. he was the first man to swim the 100-yard backstroke in less than one minute, according to the international swimming hall of fame, which inducted him in 1965.  he also set world records in the individual medley, and from 1935 through 1945, when he retired from swimming, he won 58 national championships in backstroke, individual medley and freestyle. from 1934 through 1943, he won more than 200 consecutive backstroke races.        he broke 23 records in all, including every national and world backstroke record, according to team usa.            image     kiefer at a meet in 1937. from 1934 through 1943 he won more than 200 consecutive backstroke races, and he broke 23 records in all, including every national and world backstroke record.   credit  wide world photos         kiefer was 15 when he met the captain of the university of michigan swimming team, tex robertson, who agreed to coach him. for the next three years kiefer hitchhiked from his home in chicago to ann arbor to train with robertson.  during practice at the michigan pool in 1936, kiefer bettered the american record for the 100-yard backstroke. matt mann, the michigan coach, challenged him to do it again. he did, and mann insisted that he try out for the 1936 olympic team. kiefer did, and won a place on it at 17.  in berlin, adolf hitler sought to exploit the games as a showcase of aryan athletic superiority — a plan that would be undermined by the success of the african-american sprinter and long-jumper jesse owens.  kiefer broke the olympic record for the 100-meter backstroke in the trials and semifinals and went on to set a world record of 1 minute 5.9 seconds in the final, winning the gold medal. he was 18.  “he did it with the ease and nonchalance that are the rare privilege of only the greatest athletes,” mr. ross wrote.        kiefer went on to college — actually three universities: texas, columbia and northwestern — but did not earn a degree. he entered the navy in 1942 as a specialist in the physical fitness and swimming division.  he soon found that the navy was losing more lives to drowning than to gunfire. with his superiors’ approval, he set about running swimming and lifesaving instruction for the entire navy. he called it his “greatest thrill.”  “no one could get on a ship without taking a 21-hour course in swimming,” kiefer said. “we designed lifesaving equipment and taught them what we called the victory backstroke” — which began with the arms extended over the head forming a v.  adolph gustav kiefer was born on june 27, 1918, in chicago, the fourth of seven children of german-born parents, who called him sonny. his father was a candy maker.  by kiefer’s account, his swimming life began with a near-drowning. falling by accident into an ice-cold chicago drainage canal as a child, and not knowing how to swim, he instinctively rolled onto his back and began kicking his feet furiously until he reached dry ground. he promptly took swimming lessons at a y.m.c.a. and became devoted to the sport, swimming in lake michigan and entering competitions as a student at roosevelt high school that would carry him to the olympics.            image        kiefer acknowledging the crowd at the medal ceremony during the united states olympic swimming trials in omaha in 2012.   credit  jeff haynes/reuters         after the war, hollywood producers wanted kiefer to try the movies, in one case offering him the role of tarzan. bob kiphuth, the celebrated coach at yale, wanted him to become an assistant. but kiefer turned them all down and began manufacturing swimming pool and lifesaving equipment under the name adolph kiefer and associates.        the business later became the kiefer sports group, based in zion, ill., building swimming pools, pool equipment and safety devices.  his company credits him  with introducing the first commercial line of plastic kickboards and developing the nylon swimming suit, among other innovations. kiefer owned more than a dozen patents for swimming gear and invented a flip turn for the backstroke that is still used. he  sold the business  in 2011 to a private investment firm.  kiefer was a fitness advocate who traveled the nation encouraging businesses to sponsor fitness programs for their employees.  “i sometimes believe industry stamps a man physically fit if his handshake is firm, his head steady enough to do battle with a three-martini lunch, and his bottom hard enough to sit long hours behind a desk,” the swimming hall of fame  quoted him  as saying.  kiefer’s wife, the former joyce kainer, whom he married in 1941, died in 2015. their four children — dale, jack, kathy and gail — were competitive swimmers as well, with dale and jack earning national rankings at yale.  besides his four children, kiefer is survived by 14 grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.  in later years, kiefer ran youth swimming programs in chicago. he and his wife often left their home in wadsworth, just south of the wisconsin border, to attend major meets around the world.  they also took scuba-diving trips to explore historic shipwrecks. he continued to  swim every day  in the small indoor pool at his home, even after he developed a nerve-damage condition, neuropathy, in his legs and hands, which kept him in a wheelchair except for his daily swims. the team usa website quoted him as saying that the water kept him alive.  kiefer never tired of talking about the berlin olympics, where he befriended owens, who won four gold medals.        one day, while kiefer was training, hitler came by with an entourage of nazi officials, including the powerful hermann göring. hitler had learned of kiefer’s german heritage and wanted to meet him.  “i remember him being a small man with a small hand,” kiefer told the times columnist ira berkow in 2000, “and his handshake wasn’t a firm one. then he spoke to the interpreter, and i was told he said something like, ‘this young man is the perfect example of the true aryan.’”  kiefer added: “at the time, i was honored to meet this important head of state. but if i knew then what i know now about hitler, i should have thrown him into the pool and drowned him. i even can’t stand the name adolph now. but i’m stuck with it.”       ',\n",

       " 'park city, utah — chloe kim called becoming the youngest female snowboarder to win an olympic gold medal at age 17 and sharing the moment with her south korean family in pyeongchang last february “the perfect storm, the perfect story.”  in the year since, kim, a vibrant californian with an infectious smile, has been adding chapters. on friday, she won her first world championship in the halfpipe, adding another accolade to her olympic gold medal and her fifth x games title, secured last month.  continuing to push the limits of her sport, she barely missed landing a frontside double corked 1080 on friday, the first time that she attempted the complex and dangerous trick in competition.  kim attempted it during what was essentially a victory lap. her first run score of 93.50 in the women’s halfpipe event quickly distanced her from the competition and ultimately secured her first world title.        kim, the breakout star of the 2018 olympics, has not lost in competition since january 2018. cai xuetong of china, who finished second friday, is her closest rival and a likely challenger at the beijing winter games in 2022.  “i think everybody knows chloe is the boss, so i’m just so happy i got second,” said cai, 25, who was the two-time defending world champion.  she is now preparing for her next challenge: princeton university, where she will enroll in the fall.  “i’d love to live just a normal life there, where maybe people don’t recognize me and get to know me not because of what i do, but just because of me,” she said. “anyone who is going to princeton next year, just be cool.”  kim joked that she probably would not start a princeton snowboarding team or create a minor in the sport, but said, “you know what is crazy is that they’re so open to that, which is why i love princeton so much. they really want all their students to be creative and do what they want.”        she wants to major in a science, calling chemistry her “favorite class ever.”  “i always missed the labs because i was always snowboarding,” she said.  kim is still devising a game plan to balance school and snowboarding. she enjoys hanging out in the summer months with skateboarders in southern california and taking a break from concocting creative snowboard tricks.            image     kim added a gold medal at the world championships to her gold from the 2018 olympics and a winter x games title last month.   credit  ezra shaw/getty images         “sometimes i feel like ‘i want to snowboard, i don’t want to go to school’ and then the next day i’m like ‘i want to go to school, i want to take a break from snowboarding,’ she said. “it’s such a little war going on in my head. i haven’t really figured this out yet because it is an ivy league school, which means they are a little more hands on, and i can’t really travel as much so probably do a couple contests out of the year and miss out on some.”  she said she expected to take a leave of absence from princeton at some point to train for the next olympics.  her boyfriend, toby miller, a snowboarder who many consider a protégé to the three-time olympic champion shaun white, calls kim “the golden girl.”  “she has the same mentality as shaun and just wants to keep bettering herself,” miller, 19, said. “she wants to continue to progress women’s snowboarding.”        but kim said she was not thinking about trying to equal white’s three olympic gold medals or kelly clark’s three olympic medals in snowboard halfpipe.  “i don’t know if i can do that for that long,” kim said. “it would be cool to go to the olympics three times, but i feel like i did it once and i’m really happy,” she continued. “i feel like when i’m 26, i’m going to be like my back, my arms, my legs, my shoulders, my neck. i feel like everything is going to fall apart.”  kim also has lofty aspirations away from snowboarding.  “whatever path i choose, i know it will be the right one — whether i keep snowboarding, do one more olympics and then maybe retire and pursue school and education,” kim said.  “i have so much i want to do in my life — i want to be a lawyer, i want to be a scientist, a doctor, all of these crazy things i want to try.”  she added to that list last week, after kim and her parents rescued a lost dog in park city’s kimball junction area.  “my parents saw this little thing cross the street, and there was a snowplow that was going to run the dog over,” kim said. “my dad was honking like crazy for it to stop and mom ran out, grabbed the dog and brought it into the car.”  the family cared for the frightened dog at their hotel, and kim posted a photo on instagram. within 15 minutes, she received a response and the dog’s owners came that night to retrieve it.  “i feel like after i rescued that dog, i want to start a nonprofit dog shelter,” she said. “that would be kind of cool.”       ',\n",

       " \"new haven — nathan chen’s morning had been hectic, but now he finally had a moment to relax. he flipped open his laptop and started scanning the headlines of the yale daily news as his fellow classmates filled the 400-seat auditorium for an abnormal psychology lecture.  chen’s gaze settled on an article about a classmate, sophie ascheim, the executive producer of “period. end of sentence,” which three days earlier had won an oscar in the documentary short category. ascheim, a member of chen’s residential college, was already back on campus; he had seen her that morning as they were rushing off to class.  “people do crazy impressive things here,” chen said. “then they come back and they’re normal.”            image     skateboard in hand, nathan chen exited a psychology lecture at yale.   credit  hiroko masuike/the new york times         chen, 19, is engaged in his own juggling act, balancing ivy league course work and an elite figure skating career — two worlds spinning on his index fingers.  in january,  chen aced his first major skating test since entering college — he traveled to detroit and captured his third consecutive national men’s singles title. this week, while the yale student body is on spring break, he will travel to japan to defend his world title, putting to the test the theory that being well rounded and pursuing a life off the ice might ultimately make him better at skating.        “i can’t imagine training by myself day after day,” paul wylie, a harvard graduate who won a silver medal at the 1992 olympics, said in a recent interview about chen. wylie marveled at chen’s progress. “his skating is better than ever.”  a bronze medalist in the team event last year in pyeongchang, south korea, chen isn’t the first olympian to be a full-time student and a fully engaged skater. in bygone eras, when there were fewer competitions and fame and fortune weren’t the main metrics of success, dick button, tenley albright, debi thomas and wylie all managed the duality of elite athletics and elite academics.  more recently, sarah hughes enrolled at yale after winning women’s singles at the 2002 olympics, and took time off from school to take part in an ice tour.  but as perhaps befits the man who last year became the first skater to land six jumps of four revolutions apiece in a competitive free program, chen has raised the degree of difficulty. he is approaching skating as if it were an independent study project, training by himself while checking in regularly with rafael arutyunyan, his longtime coach.            image        chen practiced at ingalls rink in new haven, home of the yale hockey teams.   credit  hiroko masuike/the new york times         chen recognizes that for the next two years, skating judges will not be the only ones carefully monitoring his every move. “there’s a lot of people who said, ‘there’s no way he’s going to be able to manage this,’” he said. “it is difficult, and i totally get that if i do poorly that might not be the greatest look.”        for chen, the risk was worth the reward of expanding his mind and his social circle. when he returned to campus after his victory at nationals, chen’s suite mates greeted him with a box of doughnuts to celebrate. he then gleaned a palatable life lesson: one doughnut won’t bring him down.   he cherishes the friends he has made and the deep conversations he has had with fellow high achievers — but also those with students who have challenged his long-held assumptions. chen, whose childhood was as carefully choreographed as one of his skating programs, said, “i’ve learned that there is literally no right or wrong answer to what to do with your life.”  and chen has found, in his study groups, a collaborative closeness that is hard to cultivate in a sport as individualized, and insular, as skating, where, as he said, “it’s not customary for other athletes to make sure you’re succeeding at the same rate.”  chen zips around campus on a motorized skateboard, potentially sacrificing safety for sleep.  “i can get up at 9:15 and make it to my 9:30 class,” he said.            image        after psych, it was off to the cafeteria, for stew, carrots and a side of quinoa.   credit  hiroko masuike/the new york times         the abnormal psychology lecture, delivered by a guest speaker and centered on the biological component of psychiatric illnesses, was chen’s third class of the day, after calculus and statistics. he stacked his schedule in the mornings so he could have his afternoons free to skate.        after absorbing a 75-minute lecture on the role of brain chemistry in depressive disorders, during which he tapped notes into his laptop, chen returned to his residential college for a hot lunch. over a plate of stew with carrots and a side of quinoa, chen explained the appeal of college.   it is a veritable smorgasbord compared with the strict fare of skating, where every day is spent around the same people with the same singular focus on performance.  “with the olympic experience i had, it has just given me a different perspective of skating,” chen said.   a year ago, he entered the pyeongchang men’s singles competition as a gold medal contender. after a disastrous short program, he sat in 17th place, then vaulted into fifth on the strength of his go-for-broke, quad-fueled free skate.  now he thinks about his once all-consuming pursuit in a different way.   “even if you win a gold medal, you have that moment of glory, but after that what happens?” chen said. “there’s so many moments that will happen after that that are more important.”            image        chen, a freshman, has an afternoon window to skate at ingalls, and also can use the athletes' weight lifting facility.   credit  hiroko masuike/the new york times         chen, who started high school in regular classes but reluctantly finished with online studies to accommodate the availability of ice time, accepted admission to yale because he felt it afforded him the best of both worlds. he is interested in studying medicine, though he is keeping his options open. a college degree is de rigueur in his family; chen&#x27;s mother is a medical translator and his father is a scientist, and he has four older siblings who are employed in the tech, aerospace and finance industries.        yale officials accommodated his training needs by offering an afternoon window of ice time at ingalls rink, the on-campus home of the men’s and women’s hockey teams. he also has the use of the weight room used by the athletic teams, where he follows a program implemented by a united states olympic committee strength and conditioning trainer.  if his studies provide him with an escape from skating, his skating provides him with a needed escape from his studies.  “i go on the ice and i can distract myself from school,” he said. “and it gives me a dopamine kick.”            image        chen repaired the divots he created with his jumps.   credit  hiroko masuike/the new york times         for most of his post-lunch, hourlong practice at ingalls, chen had the facility to himself, except for a women’s hockey player who ran up and down the arena steps. he skated over to the boards at regular intervals to manage the music on his phone. upon finishing, he grabbed a bucket of ice shavings and repaired the divots in the ice that he had created with his toe pick when he pushed off for his jumps.  the serenity of the setting suits chen, who said these solo sessions have allowed him to renew his relationship with the ice and deepen his connection to his music.  “i kind of feel like when no one’s watching i feel the most attuned to my skating,” he said.  when chen finished skating at ingalls, he changed quickly and hopped into his sport utility vehicle for the 30-minute commute to champions skating center in cromwell, conn., for additional practice.        he couldn’t dawdle; he had to get his work done and return to campus in time for his 8 p.m. music class. for the next hour, chen reeled off quads while maneuvering around more than a dozen skaters, including a little girl in hot pink skates and a youngster who was practicing her forward to backward transitions. he was struggling with one of his jumps, so he had one of the coaches at the facility take videos, which chen planned to forward to arutyunyan to critique.            image        besides training at yale, chen drives about 30 minutes to work out at a rink in cromwell, conn.   credit  hiroko masuike/the new york times         arutyunyan said the arrangement worked because he coached chen not to need him. in an email, he wrote, “i always prepare the athletes so they can cope with any problems that may occur in their career, figuratively speaking like a good parent who brings up his child with the understanding that one day he will have to solve all problems on his own.”  in a subsequent telephone interview, arutyunyan suggested that those who wonder if chen can straddle the hypercompetitive world of sport and the hypercompetitive world of an ivy league college are missing the point.  “i know olympic champions whose gold medal didn’t help their lives,” said arutyunyan, which is why, in his mind, there’s only one question worth asking: how can chen not try?       \",\n",
       " 'image      credit  doug mills/the new york times         missy franklin had just announced her retirement, hastened by chronic shoulder pain, in a letter  posted on espn’s website  when the first mournful emails arrived in my inbox. people expressed surprise that one of swimming’s brightest lights would leave the sport at “only” 23. this kind of sentiment, however well intentioned, underscores a lamentable byproduct of the professionalization of olympic sports. no longer do we grant our stars a graceful exit.  franklin left the sport more exquisitely than most, with five olympic gold medals, the world record in the 200-meter backstroke and a sterling perspective. while the tributes poured in, many of them sounding unnecessarily like eulogies marking a great competitor’s passing, franklin sagely wrote, “i choose to look at this as a new beginning.”  good for her. franklin always seemed to have her size 13 feet firmly planted on the ground. after three years of health woes that might have squeezed anybody’s passion into pulp, franklin used her farewell address to talk about the intrinsic rewards she reaped from swimming:  the lifelong friends , the lasting memories, the lessons in leadership, sportsmanship, goal-setting, time management, perseverance and humility.            franklin secured her legacy when she won five medals, including four gold, at the 2012 olympics in london. everything that followed — six gold medals at the 2013 world championships; the first women’s 200-yard freestyle faster than 1 minute 40 seconds, the 2015 n.c.a.a. team title with the university of california, berkeley; the 2016 olympics, where she won gold on a relay — was foam on the wave.        franklin made superstardom look effortless, even as she raced in a 200-meter freestyle and a 100-meter backstroke  14 minutes apart at the london olympics . but that kind of fame and excellences comes at a price.  franklin, a self-described pleaser, opened up after the 2016 olympics about  her struggles with anxiety, depression and disordered eating  — problems that were perhaps inevitable for someone wired not to disappoint people as she repeatedly interacted with fans, sponsors and swimming officials pining for the return of the indestructible “missy the missile.”  in the winter of 2016, over dinner in suburban denver, where she grew up, franklin told me about a chance encounter over the holidays. while shopping with her father, she bumped into the parent of a young woman she used to race against. she stopped to say hello and the man told franklin that everyone was rooting for her. knowing that she had slowed down a bit, he added that they were all praying that she would return to form in time for the 2016 olympics. franklin remembered thinking, “was that meant to be a compliment?”  she laughed, but at that moment the price of being america’s chlorine queen seemed exorbitant. her farewell letter provided proof that even as many openly yearned for franklin to reclaim her past glory, she was continuing to grow in ways that no timing system could measure.        if franklin had been a teenager in the 1950s or 1960s, her career would have been over after her five-medal first olympics, and, like donna de varona, she probably would have transitioned from the pool to the broadcasting booth.  if franklin had been a teenager in the 1970s, she probably would have been done with swimming, like tracy caulkins, while she was still in college.   [   read about missy franklin’s arrival on the cal campus in 2013   .]   advancements in training, equipment, and nutrition — along with an influx of cash for the elite few — have helped prolong athletic careers, but the olympians who compete into their 30s should never be considered the norm. perhaps especially if they are early bloomers like franklin, who was 5 feet 11 inches, at 13, when she became one of the youngest participants at the 2008 olympic trials.  the wear and tear of competing at a high level inevitably takes its toll. all the more so if you are a global brand ambassador being tugged at like the last cashmere sweater in a sale pile — as franklin was in the lead-up to the 2016 olympics.            image        franklin showed off her olympic medals during an appearance on \"the tonight show\" in 2012.   credit  margaret norton/nbc         instead of ruing franklin’s exit from the sport, her legions of fans should be grateful for how long she stuck around. every athlete, however wondrous, has a shelf life. if tendinitis in her shoulders hadn’t brought her to the end, something else would have — emotional burnout or maybe emerging new interests.  franklin, who is engaged to be married, said she was looking forward to becoming a mother, and wants to be able to fully engage with her future children without being restricted by physical pain. the only reason to mourn franklin’s retirement would be if the curtain was falling on her best act, but franklin sounded as if she got exactly what she needed from swimming to continue her personal and professional evolution.   “i was able to stay true to who i was,” she said in her letter, “as much in failure and disappointment as i had in winning and being the best in the world.”       ',\n",
       " \"penticton, british columbia — inside the living room of her new home, kikkan randall held a wig in her hands.  her own hair is growing back, but it is still a long way from matching the shoulder-length coiffure with the pink streaks that she sported for much of her career to remind her audience that cross-country skiers were “not boring.”  the  blond wig  with a pink streak — purchased last year in anchorage, her home city — was meant to    provide a sense of normalcy amid upheaval.  “it’s funny,” she said last week as she placed it on her no-longer bald head. “where we’re at now, i feel like i’m playing dress-up when i wear this.”        a year ago, when randall and jessie diggins  won the united states’ first olympic gold medal  in cross-country skiing and its first   medal of any kind in the sport in 42 years, randall already had breast cancer.  she just did not know it yet.  after all the wide-eyed jubilation in pyeongchang, south korea, on the night of feb. 21, 2018, randall’s realization that something might be wrong came on a much quieter evening — and served as a stark reminder that cancer doesn’t really care if you are an olympic medalist, an icon in your sport, have no family history of the disease and are more fit than 99.99 percent of the population.  it was may 13, mother’s day, less than three months after her crowning achievement. the newly retired randall; her husband, jeff ellis; and their 2-year-old son, breck, had just spent a day in the outdoors near their new home in penticton, a small canadian city that sits between two lakes in the okanagan valley.  they had hiked in the nearby mountains in the sunshine, bought a grill for their yard and shared the feeling that they were finally settling into a rhythm after months of transition and a post-olympic move from anchorage.  “we’d had the best day,” randall, 36, said. “i was so psyched on life, psyched to be a mom, psyched to be here starting our life here together. and then i was getting ready for bed and just happened to notice it.”        her fingers brushed across something hard in her right breast.  “i thought it was my rib bone at first, but then it was, ‘hmm, it feels like it’s kind of moving around in there,’” she said.  the diagnosis, delivered on may 31 by telephone as she was traveling to a wedding in sweden, was stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma.            image     kikkan randall's husband, jeff ellis, helping her put on a wig. randall received her cancer diagnosis about three months after she won an olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing.        “early on, there was definitely a heavy, why-me phase,” ellis said of randall’s reaction. “how is this possible? after all these years i finally got my medal and now i can’t enjoy it? so many years of delayed gratification. but kikkan is pretty indomitable, which means that you are not always up, but that’s the predominant spirit.”  randall and ellis have been uncommonly open throughout her treatment, particularly  on social media  — an attempt to connect with randall’s fan base and to provide others in similar situations with information and inspiration. she has posted from the wig shop, the hospital recovery room, the bathroom mirror and her penticton couch after chemotherapy and a cold caught from breck left her drained and miserable for a stretch last year.          randall found the two pea-size tumors in her breast relatively early and received an upbeat prognosis for a common type of cancer.         but as a new arrival in canada, she did not yet have health insurance. the united states olympic committee agreed to continue providing coverage throughout her extensive and expensive treatment, but she was required to receive her primary cancer care in the united states.  she chose anchorage, where her parents and many of her closest friends live and where she remains a local icon after competing in five olympics. but that meant weeks apart from jeff and breck as she shuttled between canada and alaska going through six rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, follow-up surgery and 33 sessions of radiation.  shortly before she finished her final radiation session, on jan. 25, her mother, deborah, opened a bottle of champagne to mark the occasion. the bottle had originally been purchased to celebrate randall’s long-awaited gold medal.  “when cancer happened, my mom decided that bottle had a new meaning,” randall said.            image        randall training in a room at home that contains an image of the olympic photo finish.

burdens, none heavier than the reality that randall’s treatment means she and ellis must postpone plans to have more children. that made her mother’s day discovery all the more poignant.  “when i found out i had cancer, it was almost disbelief,” randall said. “it was like, ‘i did everything right, and i’ve taken really good care of myself.’ i had put all this work in my career and was looking forward to a point where i would get the kind of time to not have to be so disciplined and enjoy the reward of all that effort. but what really has been the most upsetting is the fact we couldn’t try and have another kid right away.”        in her mid-30s , with a tight window before she needed to start chemotherapy in july, randall said she had enough time for one cycle of fertility drugs so the couple could try to have another child later. she and ellis worked with a clinic in seattle, which was unable to ship her some of the necessary medication because of import regulations. so randall drove about 50 miles to the border, picked up the medicine and brought it back to penticton.  she said she produced nine eggs, six of which were viable. five embryos were then created, but only three made it through the first week. of those three, randall said, only one did not have a high risk of leading to a miscarriage.  “we would have loved to have three, but we got one, and you have about a 60 percent chance of that becoming a viable pregnancy,” she said.  randall and ellis have nicknamed the surviving embryo little frosty.  “he’s hanging out in seattle in storage, and they can keep embryos up to 10 years,” she said.  randall said she expected to be on anti-hormone medication for at least five years, possibly as long as 10. pregnancy is not advisable during such treatment, although randall said she might be able to take a break from the medication to pursue having a child.  “if we only ever end up with breck, he’s amazing,” randall said.            image        the view from randall's home in penticton, british columbia.        the family moved to penticton for a job opportunity for ellis, a former 400-meter hurdler for canada, who was later an elite cross-country skier. but he said he left his new job in july to play a bigger role with breck and to have more flexibility to help randall.        after they moved to canada for ellis’s career, randall’s pursuits are again taking precedence.   the couple now work together out of the house, focusing on randall’s business and charitable opportunities .  her regimen includes training in the small workout room on the ground floor. last friday morning, she put herself through a brisk circuit of weight lifting, dips, resistance band work and other exercises that she has tried to maintain since entering what she calls her g.i. jane phase. she shaved her head after her hair began to fall out in clumps early in chemotherapy.  randall likes to do laundry between sets, and her deep breathing was often drowned out by the sound of a washing machine shifting through its cycles. bottles of detergent share space on shelves with mementos from her and ellis’s athletic careers.  a photo of the gold medal finish from pyeongchang, with diggins’s arms thrust triumphantly skyward, sits atop a baseboard heater where randall can see it as she sweats. though there are signs of the strain, such as dark half-circles under her eyes, she looks lean and fit.  “thankfully all the muscles didn’t go away,” she said.            image        randall with her son, breck, and her husband, jeff ellis, at the nickel plate nordic centre.        she has put them to use: biking to and from her cancer treatments in anchorage and hopping on skis very soon after her lumpectomy, using only one pole for a time to avoid overworking her right side. in september, she won a 10-kilometer run in penticton, and last month, while still finishing radiation treatment, she won the women’s event at a duathlon ski race in anchorage.        “i don’t think cancer patients are told enough what they  can  do,” she said.  randall, who has a port implanted in her chest to continue receiving injections of the drug herceptin, wants to promote physical activity during treatment. she has taken inspiration from and spoken with gabriele grunewald, the 32-year-old american middle-distance runner, who has continued to compete despite dealing with more virulent forms of cancer.           chemotherapy, then the u.s. championships, for gabriele grunewald  june 19, 2017            randall has no plans to return to top-level competition and has not skied more than 30 kilometers since her cancer diagnosis, but she will take part in the american birkebeiner, a 50-kilometer ski marathon in hayward, wis., on saturday. she then heads to china to take part in sprint ski races in the bird’s nest stadium as part of the buildup to the 2022 winter olympics in beijing. in november, she intends to run the new york city marathon.  she also has regular meetings as a member of the international olympic committee and the board of the u.s.o.c. those positions don’t come with a salary, so she needs to generate regular income through speaking engagements and sponsorships.  the whirlwind, if she stays healthy, will resume soon enough. but last saturday, with the weather and the agenda clear, she and ellis packed their minivan with gear and drove about 45 minutes west to the groomed cross-country trails of nickel plate nordic centre.  ellis    clicked into his bindings and towed breck in a carrier with randall whooping alongside them as they headed down a gentle slope. later, as she sprinted across the snow on her own, the rest of her family took a break.  “after everything, it’s great to see her out there on skis,” ellis said. “it’s her happy place.”            image        randall training on apex mountain, near her home.       \",\n",
       " 'spindleruv mlyn, czech republic — mikaela shiffrin returned this weekend to the relatively unknown czech ski resort where she began her world cup ski racing career in 2011 as an inexperienced 15-year-old.  “coming back here all these memories are kind of flashing back to me,” said shiffrin, now 23.  she recalled a meeting with u.s. ski team coaches and teammates, including lindsey vonn, the night before her first race on march 11, 2011.  “i was star struck on every level,” shiffrin said. “i thought, ‘i’m here to do business, but i’m also kind of scared of everybody.’ it was terrifying.”  since then, shiffrin has established herself as one of history’s greatest ski racers. in addition to a pair of world championship gold medals last month in sweden, she has amassed 14 world cup victories this season, equaling the record set by vreni schneider of switzerland in 1989. with a slalom scheduled for saturday, shiffrin should have four more opportunities to surpass the mark.        shiffrin settled for third place in the giant slalom friday in mild, wet conditions in the krkonose mountains. the crowd favorite, petra vlhova of slovakia, won the race, posting a two-run time six-tenths of a second faster than shiffrin, and 0.11 ahead of viktoria rebensburg of germany.  shiffrin came up just three points shy of clinching her first career giant slalom season title, with one race remaining, in soldeu, andorra, on march 17.  she said she skied “angry” in the second run with the title on the line.  vlhova, 23, who has five victories this season, said, “it is all the time good to race against mikaela because we are always close and she continues to push me.”  shiffrin clinched her third overall world cup last weekend by virtue of races being canceled in sochi, russia; her lead over vlhova is insurmountable.  “the globes are my main goal this season,” shiffrin said, referring to the trophies for the overall and various discipline titles.        the czech republic races provide a framework for a stellar career, most notably three overall world cup titles, six consecutive slalom titles, gold medals at the last two olympics and 57 world cup victories, among numerous other records.  in 2011, just days before her 16th birthday, shiffrin showcased her tremendous potential. she remembered finishing “four or five seconds out” in her first giant slalom. but she skied inspired in slalom, narrowly missing the top-30 cut for the second run by five-hundredths of a second.  mikaela’s mother and coach, eileen, said her daughter’s return to spindleruv mlyn had been thrilling and reflective.  “still, every day, i’m like, ‘are you kidding?,’” eileen shiffrin said. “it’s definitely been a long haul and really fun at the same time.”  in 2011, after the czech races, mikaela shiffrin cherished her 16th birthday present from her father: a business class ticket from prague to vancouver, british columbia, for another competition, extending her birthday across nine times zones.  “it felt very extravagant,” shiffrin said. “we got to watch movies and had orange juice when we first sat down on the plane.”  now, shiffrin occasionally travels to important races on chartered planes, her popularity across world sport rapidly soaring.        “i think in almost every way, i’m still as simple as the girl who was excited to fly business class on her birthday on the way home from my first world cup race,” she said. “it’s still who i am.  “almost everything has changed, but at the same time almost nothing has changed, so it’s funny to be back here. it’s like a time warp.”       ',\n",
       " 'minutes after a race training session last november, lindsey vonn sat in a colorado condominium repeatedly adjusting a bulky ice bag on her aching right knee.  “i’m old,” she said with a muffled laugh.  the conversation turned to how much longer vonn would race; the record for career world cup victories was within her grasp.  “not long,” vonn insisted. “this record is not a hill to die on for me.”  on friday, after another serious knee injury sidelined her again, vonn, 34, announced her retirement from ski racing.  “my body is screaming at me to stop, and it’s time for me to listen,” vonn posted on her instagram account. she added that she would race twice at the world championships next week in are, sweden, but that those events would be the last of her career.        “i have accepted that i cannot continue ski racing,” vonn wrote.  vonn leaves as the greatest female skier in history, with her 82 world cup victories second only to sweden’s ingemar stenmark, who won 86.            in lindsey vonn’s quest for greatness, her body has paid a price  at 33, vonn has sustained many injuries and made legendary comebacks. all in all, her desire to keep ski racing at highway speeds is unquenchable.       vonn, who became the first american woman to win an olympic downhill at the 2010 vancouver games, also won an unprecedented 20 season-long world cup discipline and overall titles from 2008 to 2016. vonn also won two olympic bronze medals (in 2010 and 2018) and seven world championship medals from 2005 to 2017.  moreover, as a telegenic, marketable sporting personality, she attracted dozens of corporate sponsorships and commercial endorsements, which made her renowned worldwide and led to scores of national media appearances that significantly raised the profile of ski racing in america. with a vast social media following — much of it built on videos she posted of her daunting exercise regimen — vonn also tried to use her crossover celebrity status to empower women’s athletics. she established a foundation to aid young female skiers while challenging traditional norms in the male-dominated international ski racing federation, her sport’s governing body.  vonn frequently trained with men and adopted the more aggressive, powerful tactics and techniques employed on the riskier men’s racecourses. she used the stiffer men’s skis and several times over the years attempted to enter men’s world cup races. and when vonn was barred from those races, she loudly protested. her requests to race against men were never granted, but throughout that period vonn’s quest to compete on the men’s circuit brought new and valued attention to the gains and accomplishments of women’s alpine racing.        even vonn’s personal life made news: for two years beginning in 2013, she dated tiger woods, then the world’s most famous athlete.  but on friday, vonn said the long list of debilitating injuries she had endured in a daredevil sport had finally caught up with her. she also revealed that she had another, previously undisclosed knee operation last year.  “my body is broken beyond repair, and it isn’t letting me have the final season i dreamed of,” vonn said.            image     from late 2014 to the spring of 2018, vonn won 23 world cup races, putting her within four victories of ingemar stenmark’s career record — a mark long considered unassailable.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         for much of her career, vonn became synonymous with high-speed crashes and the injuries that ensued — along with stirring comebacks that she mounted in the aftermath of those mishaps. at the 2006 turin olympics, where she was a medal contender in multiple events, vonn was airlifted off the mountain when she stumbled during a training run at 60 miles an hour, somersaulted until she flew off a jump backward and landed with a chilling thud.  doctors scanned or x-rayed vonn’s body from her shoulders to her ankles expecting to discover multiple broken bones but instead found only serious bruises. after a night in a hospital, vonn competed in four events, although her highest finish was seventh.  vonn, whose maiden name was kildow, married thomas vonn, a former united states ski team member known for his shrewd use of ski equipment technologies, in 2007. thomas vonn became his wife’s manager and primary coach, and vonn blossomed into the most dominant racer in the sport, winning three consecutive world cup overall titles beginning in 2008.        entering the 2010 vancouver olympics, vonn was the favorite in at least three events until she injured her shin roughly a week before the start of the games. several days of weather delays aided her recovery, and vonn dramatically won the downhill with a bold, fearless descent down an especially perilous racecourse. vonn’s american teammate and longtime rival julia mancuso won the silver medal.  at the world championships in february 2013 — her divorce from thomas vonn had recently been finalized — vonn endured another spectacular tumble, tearing two knee ligaments and breaking a bone in her right leg. screaming as she lay in the snow, vonn later conceded that she knew she would never again push out of a start gate fully healthy.  nonetheless, she rushed back from the reconstruction of her knee’s anterior cruciate ligament to prepare for the approaching 2014 sochi olympics. instead, she tore the same ligament in her right knee during training. she tried racing without the ligament but ultimately bowed out of the olympics a month before they started.            image        vonn was airlifted off the course after crashing at the world championships in austria in 2013 &mdash; one of the long list of debilitating injuries she endured.   credit  luca bruno/associated press         “those injuries changed the trajectory of my career — changed it forever, basically,” vonn said in 2018, subconsciously, or consciously, rubbing her right knee as she spoke. “just devastating. a very dark moment in my career.”  but she rallied to rule the downhill and super-g events as she had before, despite a broken left ankle in 2015 and a broken right arm in 2016 that caused nerve damage so substantial vonn had to tape her right hand to her ski pole while racing.  “her willingness to do absolutely anything to keep racing and to keep winning inspired everyone who had to go against her,” said sophia goggia, the olympic gold medalist in the downhill at the 2018 pyeongchang olympics. “you always knew she might catch you because no one has done the things lindsey vonn has done.”        from late 2014 to the spring of 2018, vonn won another 23 world cup races, which put her within four victories of stenmark’s career record, set in 1989 — a mark long considered unassailable.  at the start of this season, most in the ski racing community expected vonn to surpass stenmark, and if she had, her racing brethren were prepared to call her the greatest skier ever, without any gender qualifier.  “if she gets the most world cup wins, it’s 100 percent not about her being female,” kjetil jansrud of norway, who has won seven olympic and world championship medals, said before the season began. “lindsey would deserve the greatest title because she has the numbers.”            image        vonn became the first american woman to win an olympic downhill at the 2010 vancouver games.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         bode miller, considered america’s greatest male ski racer, said he believed vonn was the best skier ever even without her having exceeded stenmark’s record, especially as vonn was the rare skier who won world cup races in five alpine disciplines: the downhill, the super-g, the slalom, the giant slalom and the combined.  all of stenmark’s victories came in two events, the slalom and the giant slalom.  “in my opinion, she is at the top,” miller told reuters in january. “stenmark lived in a different era and never had to deal with the things lindsey had to deal with throughout her career. even just the number of races he had in a season was different to lindsey.  “stenmark raced 14 or 15 events a season, and that’s nowhere near what she’s had.”  but vonn’s quest to catch stenmark this season was derailed on nov. 19, 2018, when she toppled during a colorado training session and tore the lateral collateral ligament in her left knee, which had been her good knee. vonn missed roughly six weeks of races and multiple opportunities to close the gap on stenmark, including three races at lake louise, alberta, where vonn had won 18 times.        she returned to race on jan. 18 this year but struggled to find her form, finishing 15th and ninth in successive downhills and then failing to finish a super-g. she has not raced since.  seated in the slopeside colorado condominium late last year, vonn continued to fidget with the ice bag on her knee, but she insisted she was at peace with her legacy.  “i know it’s time to give up ski racing, but i’m o.k. with that,” she said. “i’ve already done a lot of things that no one else has done. i tried to be good for the sport, tried to advance women’s ski racing and had a lot of days i’ll treasure.  “the sport gave all that to me. so i’m good. it’s been a little unpredictable maybe, but it’s been a great run.”       ',\n",
       " \"a young austrian apprentice wagon maker, josef fischer, decided to strike out on his own in 1924 in the trade of “wagon making and the manufacture of wooden products.” he started off with toboggans and then, the next year, he made a pair of skis. they were cut from locally grown beech or brook ash — no one is really sure — and measured 220 centimeters long. he sold them for the princely sum of  140,000 crowns .  that fischer started to make alpine skis in the first place is somewhat surprising because his hometown, ried im innkreis, in upper austria just to the west of linz, is surrounded by gentle rolling hills dotted with pear trees. there is nothing resembling a mountain for as far as the eye can see.   but the factory is still in the town, albeit at a grander site, and remains the only large-scale, family-run ski manufacturer in the world.            image     pears lay on a  road outside ried im innkreis, the austrian town where the fischer factory is based.         the plant is able to make 1,700 alpine and nordic skis a day, though production fluctuates during the year according to demand and the release of new models. many of the 480 workers have spent their entire careers at the factory.         although the majority of the production line is now automated, many details still need to be worked by hand, imbuing the factory with an air of craft and technical know-how. fischer opened a plant in mukachevo, ukraine, in the 1980s, for most production, but the ried im innkreis plant handles the most complicated skis: those tailor-made for world cup downhill and slalom racers, carbon cross-country skis and skis for jumping, whose crafting process is so secret a visiting reporter was not permitted to watch.  new technologies and secrets, of course, have always been an integral part of ski manufacturing. josef fischer jr., the son of the founder, pushed to experiment with new techniques, particularly lighter, composite skis. his father, however, told him that “it was nonsense to cut up the wood first, only to glue it back together in a different way.”   but after josef fischer sr. died unexpectedly in 1959, his son’s focus turned toward making the company competitive in elite ski racing, and he decided to develop its first metal ski, the alu-metal.            image        a worker preparing core material for the final production process.         image        curv alpine skis on the production line.      image             when egon zimmermann of austria used those skis to race to the gold medal on the patscherkofel course at the 1964 winter olympics in innsbruck, austria, he scored a major coup for fischer. the company’s skis had been perceived as being for “the army and the general public,” zimmermann said, but victory changed that.   production surged, a new factory was built and the company’s standing in alpine skiing was cemented when franz klammer, on fischer’s c4 skis, flew down the same mountain to win the gold medal in downhill at the 1976 winter games. despite going 15th, the last of the seeded skiers and with the course already roughed up, klammer thrilled the home nation and the world to pull off one of the most dramatic downhill victories in olympic history.            image        a worker on the alpine ski production line adding sidewalls to a ski's base.            image              fischer looked to branch out in the 1970s and entered the nordic ski market — and even the tennis racket business — focused on producing lighter skis than its competitors. within a few years it became, and remains, a dominant force in nordic skiing.   although there are a host of competing brands, such as atomic, head and rossignol, producing elite-level skis, fischer outfitted the most medal-winners overall —  89 out of 160   — at the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, earlier this year.            image        during a break, a trolley of snacks was brought out for workers.        technically, little separates the equipment of the top ski makers, so often it is personal customization that dominates design decisions. alpine skiers, in particular, have distinct preferences for stiffness and weight, and the fischer factory in ried im innkreis makes skis adapted to their individual styles and the varied snow conditions they will encounter during the long world cup season.   most cross-country and biathlon athletes have their skis chosen by their own technical specialists from the elite-level stock stored at the factory. these technicians will carefully cast their eyes along the hundreds of seemingly identical skis, running their fingers along the edges and balancing the skis in their hands, searching for the special pair that will somehow save their skier a few precious milliseconds, which is often the difference between glory and defeat.            image        officials for the russian biathlon team picking out skis.            image        at

       " 'killington, vt. — mikaela shiffrin made her debut on the professional world cup ski racing tour in 2011 when she was 15. two years later, she was the first american to win two world cup races before she was 18. a year after that, she was the youngest olympic slalom champion in history.  times have changed.  before a recent race, shiffrin was looking at the list of competitors when she realized — gasp! — she was older than nearly half the field.  “i’ve been used to being the baby,” said shiffrin, 23. “but now i hear the birth year of some girls and i swear it sounds like ‘2017,’ and i’m like, ‘wait, what?’”  a teenage phenomenon no longer, shiffrin is an adult with all the trappings of the modern pro athlete: a gaggle of sponsors and a brand to cultivate, public appearances and media obligations, and yes, an ambitious throng of up-and-comers nipping at the heels of perhaps the most precocious talent in her sport’s history. it’s no wonder she spent part of her off-season shadowing roger federer.        “i’ve been thinking: oh, man, this is what it felt like for everybody else when i was coming up the ranks,” shiffrin said as she sat in a colorado condo after a training session this month.  but shiffrin, a three-time olympic medalist and the two-time defending women’s world cup overall champion, is not overly vexed by her veteran status.  “everybody goes through it — time keeps moving on,” she said. “we get older and hopefully more mature.”  moreover, when asked if she felt her career was entering a new stage, she answered without the slightest hesitation: “i feel like i’m constantly entering a different stage.”        that may be the most apt description of shiffrin’s incandescent career.  shiffrin’s charge through the ski racing record books — she is on a pace to shatter a host of world cup and olympic records — could continue this weekend with two world cup races at the killington ski resort in vermont. shiffrin has become the pied piper and the main attraction of the event, which returned to vermont for the first time in nearly 40 years in 2016.            image     as she embarks on a new season, shiffrin said, “i feel like i’m constantly entering a different stage.”   credit  doug mills/the new york times         since then, the killington races have drawn some of the biggest crowds on the women’s circuit, a tour primarily based in europe.  shiffrin has continued to represent the new guard of ski racing in america, especially with lindsey vonn retiring after this season. vonn injured her knee in training on monday, which will delay her debut on this year’s world cup circuit.  shiffrin is careful not to be seen as nudging vonn out of the way when vonn is only four victories from tying the record for most career world cup wins (86), set in 1989 by ingemar stenmark of sweden.  but shiffrin at 23 is what the 34-year-old vonn was 11 years ago: a complete skier entering her prime. shiffrin, like vonn before her, is the rare breed willing to tackle the mental and physical demands of competing in all five race categories, from the relatively low speeds but technical difficulty of the slalom to the daredevil danger of the downhill.  with the substantial triumphs and one hard-earned disappointment from the 2018 pyeongchang olympics now in shiffrin’s rearview mirror, she embarks on a new season. that includes, of course, the changes in the latest chapter of an already eventful career.  maybe the best way to depict what’s different with shiffrin now is to consider how she spent her off-season. she used to look forward to several weeks of summer at home in her parents’ colorado home, where she would catch up on unviewed episodes of favorite television shows, like “madam secretary” or “blue bloods.”        this year, shiffrin went on a caribbean vacation with her boyfriend, the french ski racer mathieu faivre; was a presenter at the espy awards; attended a festival in cannes; and, providently, came in regular contact with federer, who, like shiffrin, is sponsored by the pasta maker barilla.  at functions with federer, shiffrin found herself assiduously studying how the tennis star behaved and interacted with the public.          “he was engaged with every person he was talking to — it wasn’t like he was just looking at his phone and not them,” she said. “i don’t even think he had his phone with him. i watched how he conducted himself around people in general or with the media. it was eye-opening to see how fully he gave of himself.  “it was an important thing for me to learn at this point in my career.”  comportment is increasingly imperative to shiffrin because her many accomplishments have led to a plethora of valuable partnerships with corporate sponsors, who expect certain standards, and not just those achieved on a ski slope.  “i often think of myself as a literal investment,” she said. “it sounds serious, like kind of dehumanizing, but i’m conscious of the brand. i think there are some athletes who don’t think about that enough.            image        shiffrin won the world cup slalom race in finland last week. the prize included a reindeer.   credit  markku ulander/agence france-presse — getty images         “i’m a human and a person, and a ski racer. but i have sponsors who invest in me hoping that i’m going to stay the course and have success. i feel like you don’t want to skirt around that.”  to that end, despite her new off-season interests, shiffrin said she did not alter her usual, exacting routine of on-snow race training in the southern hemisphere, along with hourslong daily gym work. this winter, she still expects to expand her experience as a speed skier and enter more downhill and super-g races, something that will be watched with heightened interest within the greater ski racing community.  it will be a taxing schedule to maintain, and undoubtedly the most significant test to her continued ascent in the sport.  at the 2018 pyeongchang games, for example, weather delays compressed the race timetable and added to shiffrin’s overall race fatigue, which caused her to  withdraw from the downhill  and super-g events.  with probably two, or maybe three, more olympic games in her future, learning to manage her time and conserve her energy was undoubtedly among the most crucial lessons.  at pyeongchang, she  won a silver medal in the combined event  and  dominated the giant slalom  to become only the third american to win two olympic alpine gold medals. but in her best event, the slalom, where she regularly wins races by wide margins,  she was a surprising fourth .  the day before the slalom, the ceremony in which she would receive her giant slalom gold medal went deep into the night, keeping shiffrin awake more than two hours past her usual bedtime. she is known for requiring at least nine hours of sleep a day; her preparation for the next day’s race would begin around 6 a.m.        knowing that the other medal recipients that night were not competing the next day, shiffrin said she begged officials to allow her to receive her medal earlier in the ceremony. but the order was prearranged; shiffrin, one of the featured athletes in the games, was scheduled to appear on the awards stage last.  “they said to me, ‘this is the olympics, this is the way it goes,’” shiffrin said. “and i thought: you know what? i did just win an olympic gold medal and i’m going to enjoy it. i’m going to do every single interview and have fun at the awards and not really worry about having to refocus for the slalom, because what’s going to happen is going to happen.  “i was hoping for the best.”  a scarf draped across her shoulders, shiffrin shrugged. she looked neither upset nor satisfied, maybe even just a bit older and wiser.  “it didn’t quite work out,” she said. “you live and learn.”       ',\n",
       " 'steven holcomb, a brawny three-time olympic medalist who overcame a disease that threatened his vision, and then in 2010 piloted a four-man bobsled team to the united states’ first gold medal in the event in 62 years, was found dead on saturday. he was 37.  holcomb was found in a dormitory at the olympic training center in lake placid, n.y., where he had been training in the off-season, his agent, brant feldman, said. frank whitelaw, the coroner in essex county, n.y., said there were no signs of foul play. an autopsy was scheduled for sunday, he said.  holcomb had kept a busy schedule over the past month amid preparations for the 2018 olympics in pyeongchang, south korea. he filmed a fishing show in key west, fla., for a cable network and spent several days in los angeles filming scenes for a documentary about his life. he also joined about 100 other olympic hopefuls to record promotional videos for nbc, which will televise the games.  holcomb won five world titles and was a six-time overall world cup champion and a 60-time world cup medalist.        in his autobiography, “but now i see: my journey from blindness to olympic gold,” holcomb disclosed that he had battled depression and had attempted suicide in 2007. he said he believed the depression had stemmed largely from the fight to save his vision.  he had been scheduled to fly to minnesota on sunday to review bobsled gear for the next season, his agent said. in the 2016-17 bobsled world cup, which ended six weeks ago, holcomb finished second in the two-man event and third in the four-man.  holcomb had secured his place as a top bobsledder at the vancouver games in 2010. the united states team entered those olympics as the world’s no. 1 squad, but it was up against the perennially dominant germans and six decades of history.  during four runs over two days, holcomb and the three other americans in usa-1 made their task look easy. at speeds that reached 95 miles per hour, holcomb steered his team’s sleek black sled (nicknamed night train) calmly through the course’s 16 stomach-turning curves. he and his fellow sledders even glided through the most treacherous turn, curve 13, which holcomb had called 50-50 after watching half the bobsleds crash on it the first time he trained there.  holcomb’s team completed its four runs in 3 minutes 42.46 seconds, beating germany for the gold medal by less than half a second and ending the long gold medal drought.        “no more 62 years,” holcomb  said after the victory . “we’ll start the clock over. now it’s going to be four years.”            image     steven holcomb and steven langton celebrating after a run that earned them a bronze medal in the two-man bobsled competition at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia.   credit  josh haner/the new york times         holcomb fell short of repeating at the sochi games in 2014, but he drove his teams to bronze medals in the two- and four-man events.  steven holcomb was born on april 14, 1980, in park city, utah, where he grew up and continued to live. he split his time between there and lake placid, the two places believed to have the only bobsled tracks in the nation.  he started competing for the united states in 1998 but did not qualify for an olympic team until 2006 at the turin games.  he is survived by his father, steve; his mother, jean beethe; and two sisters, feldman said.  holcomb looked out of place among the ranks of chiseled olympians and sleek bobsledders. his stocky build gave him a look that marketers said was more likely to land him in a beer commercial than on a wheaties box.  his rise in the bobsled world coincided with the start of his sight problems, attributed to keratoconus, a degenerative eye disease. he wore contact lenses that corrected his vision to 20/60 from 20/500, a level that qualified him as legally blind. “i was able to drive without being able to see,” he said in an interview with cbs news. “you just learn to drive by feel.”        but his sight continued to worsen, a fact that holcomb kept hidden from some friends and relatives. he was told in 2007 there were no other types of contact lenses that could help him. lasik surgery seven years earlier had made his vision worse. doctors told him that he needed a cornea transplant and that he would have to retire from sports because an accident or collision could dislodge the transplant.  holcomb, who finished first in the two-man event in the 2006-7 world cup, had hoped to compete in the 2010 vancouver games. he felt hopeless, he wrote in his autobiography.  one night in 2007, after a fourth drink of jack daniel’s, he swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills in an attempt at suicide. “just like my blindness, i chose to battle the demon on my own,” he wrote, “without telling anyone or seeking help from others.”  later in the year, he had a relatively new procedure that placed contacts permanently behind his irises to improve his sight. it worked, and his vision was 20/20.  holcomb had every intention of making the united states squad for the pyeongchang games, feldman said. he planned to finish training in lake placid this month before traveling to east tennessee state university to continue training over the summer.  “he had a great season,” feldman said, “and he was in really great shape to make it.”       ',\n",
       " 'this weekend is wisconsin forward annie pankowski’s last shot to go out a winner in college hockey.  she is a three-time finalist for the patty kazmaier award, which will be given out saturday to the best female player in college hockey. she has never won.  on friday, she will play in the frozen four with the wisconsin badgers for the fourth time. she has never won a national championship.  top-seeded wisconsin (33-4-2) faces the two-time defending champion clarkson (30-7-2) on friday in the semifinals at quinnipiac university in hamden, conn., with minnesota (31-5-1) and cornell (24-5-6) vying to play the winner. the title game is sunday.  “all the previous frozen fours have been different, but this one is my last,” pankowski, 24, said. “as a team, we’re really hungry to win it.”        a native of laguna hills, calif., whose older sister, ali, played hockey at princeton, pankowski started skating at 4 and played on her first united states national team in 2013, before four years at the north american hockey academy in stowe, vt. at wisconsin, she was the team’s leading scorer her first two years, and again this year, with 25 goals and 47 points. she won four conference championships with the badgers.  yet pankowski’s hockey career has had devastating setbacks. she was a final cut for the 2014 olympic team. she did not play for the badgers in the 2017-18 season as she trained with the national team. but she was cut just weeks before the team was to leave for the pyeongchang olympics, after all the players had been assured when training camp began that the 23-person roster was set. the u.s. went on to win the gold medal.  pankowski called it “one of the most awkward, painful experiences of my life.” the day after she was cut, still “heartbroken, confused and angry,” she said, she began the drive back to madison, where she knew she would find support among coaches, teammates and friends.  “those were the people i needed to surround myself with,” she said.  she finished the season practicing with her wisconsin teammates, and throwing herself into another passion: training dogs.  since her second semester at wisconsin, she has been a volunteer at occupaws, a local nonprofit that trains guide dogs for people with sight and mobility disabilities. the program requires that the dogs live with her.        “it’s something outside of hockey and school that’s not stressful,” said pankowski, who often treats her teammates to dog visits at practice. “you can feel the excitement whenever i bring a dog into the locker room.”            image     pankowski is a three-time finalist for the patty kazmaier award, which goes to the best female player in college hockey.   credit  tom lynn         pankowski, the youngest child of two veterinarians, has logged more than 2,000 hours of volunteer time with occupaws. that is one of the reasons she is a finalist for another honor: the hockey humanitarian award, which recognizes a male or female player who makes significant contributions to the community through volunteering.  pankowski also works in the lab of mark markel, the dean of wisconsin’s school of veterinary medicine, and she plans to start veterinary school there in august.  “she’s a rock star as an athlete, a student, a volunteer and a worker in my lab,” markel said. “i think all her hockey experience, including all the international tournaments she’s played in, has given her the discipline to pull off this off.”  veterinary school is a four-year program, but a yearlong commitment to play in the 2022 olympics in beijing is possible, with markel’s blessing.  “if she needs a year off,” he said, “we’re totally supportive of her.”  for now, though, her focus is on friday night and clarkson, the team that beat wisconsin in the 2017 title game. the badgers were the top team in the country all of that season and outshot clarkson, 41-20,  but lost, 3-0 .        this year, wisconsin heads into the frozen four 10-0-2 in its last 12 games. pankowski scored wisconsin’s first two goals in a 4-0 win over syracuse in the n.c.a.a. quarterfinals last weekend.  watching the game online, bill driscoll, the director of hockey at the north american hockey academy, said he knew she would “take this game over.”  “she has an elite-level shot,” he added.  pankowski was on the u.s. team that won the four nations cup in november, and she will play for the americans at the world championships in finland next month. despite her olympic disappointments, she has won two gold medals at worlds, in 2015 and 2016.  “she’s very cerebral on the ice,” said bob corkum, the national team coach. “she knows the spots to get to. she’s not the fastest skater or the strongest player or even the most skilled, but she’s very well rounded. all she does is put pucks in the net.”  whatever the results this weekend, markel said, he had no worries about how pankowski will handle them.  “i think her resilience is going to be a blessing for her the rest of her life,” he said.

       " 'jeanne ashworth, who arrived at the 1960 winter olympics in squaw valley, calif., in the first group of women to compete in speedskating at any olympics and  won a bronze medal in the 500-meter race , died on oct. 4 at her home in wilmington, n.y., near lake placid. she was 80.  her longtime partner, christine lefevre, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.  ashworth had won several speedskating championships in the united states when she arrived at the outdoor olympic skating rink in squaw valley on feb. 20, 1960. she was nervous, having spent a sleepless night wondering if russian women would sweep the four women’s races.  “remember,” her mother, alberta, told her, “they’re only human beings.”  in a race in which the skaters compete against each other in pairs, ashworth and a competitor went ninth. she had to better the earlier results of  helga haase of germany , who finished at 45.9 seconds, and  natalia donchenko  of the soviet union, whose time was 46.0 seconds.  “i remember i was on a kind of magic carpet,”  ashworth told the lowell sun in 2010 . “about 10 seconds from the finish, i kind of hesitated and struggled to the end. it took about two-tenths of a second off” — the difference between a bronze and gold medal.        her time, 46.1 seconds, earned her the bronze. she was the only american woman to win a speedskating medal at squaw valley.  ashworth helped move women toward an equal footing with men in speedskating. the sport had been an all-male domain since it was introduced at the 1924 winter games in chamonix, france. women’s speedskating was given so-called demonstration sport status at the 1932 winter games in lake placid, n.y., but those results did not count.  she was not done at squaw valley after the 500-meter race. she competed in three other events — she earned no other medals — but was pleased with her overall performance.  “it was all so lucky because i didn’t know too much about what i was doing,” she said, summarizing her success in  an interview with lake placid news  in 2016. “i just went out and skated fast.”        a few days after the 500-meter race, ashworth found herself in the center of a dispute described as a “mutiny” by the media. she was quoted by united press international as saying that she could have been helped by having a coach “who knew something about olympic skating,” and that the only coaching she had received in squaw valley had been from a russian competitor, klara guseva-nesterova.            image     ashworth began skating on a small pond near her house in massachusetts when she was around 7 or 8. she competed in her first race, at boston garden, when she was 10.   credit  lake placid olympic museum         although one of her teammates supported her, ashworth insisted that she had been misquoted. she did say, however, that american speedskaters “should study more the science of skating as the russians do.”  jeanne chesley ashworth was born on july 1, 1938, in burlington, vt., and moved with her family to wilmington, mass., when she was young. her father, raymond, and her mother, alberta (black) ashworth, ran a candy and homemade ice cream shop. jeanne began skating on a small pond near her house when she was around 7 or 8 and competed in her first race, at boston garden, when she was 10.  “the boston pops played before the race and during the race,” she told lake placid news. “it was amazing.”  she lost the race but joined the local skating club. she also played field hockey, basketball and softball in high school before graduating from tufts university with a bachelor’s degree in physical therapy science.  her success at the olympics did not come as a surprise: she had been winning national indoor and outdoor titles for at least two years. and, in an interview with the boston globe after she had made the 1960 olympic team, she predicted, “i am perfectly confident i haven’t yet reached what is to be my maximum speed.”  ashworth returned to skate in the 1964 winter games in innsbruck, austria, and in the 1968 olympics in grenoble, france. her best finish was a fourth-place tie in the 500-meter race in innsbruck.        during her competitive years, she moved to wilmington, n.y., in the adirondack mountains, and her parents soon followed her there.  when she finished skating, she worked as a high school teacher and speedskating coach and helped her parents run the candy concession at  santa’s workshop , north pole, ny, in wilmington. she was also the town supervisor of wilmington and a skilled woodworker.  in addition to ms. lefevre, she is survived by her daughter, kristen ashworth; two grandchildren; and a sister, jacqueline peters. her marriage to harless walker ended in divorce.  ms. ashworth donated her bronze medal to the lake placid olympic museum.  “this is part of the world,” she told the lowell sun. “this is what you share.”       ',\n",
       " 'when the winnipeg jets play host to the colorado avalanche on thursday night, the meeting will be more than a showcase of the central division leader against the league’s top-scoring line. it will be a glimpse of a decade-long transformation of finnish hockey.  patrik laine of winnipeg, 20, and mikko rantanen of colorado, 22, have spent much of their young n.h.l. careers among the league leaders in scoring, gaining a spotlight for a golden generation from finland, one of the smallest, and most successful, hockey-playing nations.  “that age group in finland, there must be something in the water or they’re feeding them the right things up there,” said the winnipeg captain, blake wheeler.  seven players from finland, a country of 5.5 million, have been top 10 draft picks since 2013, and nearly all of them are playing significant roles on their n.h.l. teams.        laine, the no. 2 pick in 2016, almost immediately became the most recognizable face in finnish hockey since teemu selanne. despite some lean scoring stretches this season, laine has been one of the league’s best goal-scorers over the past three seasons. in november, he scored five goals on five shots in a game against the st. louis blues, and he became the fourth-youngest player to reach 100 career goals.  the highlight of that month for laine was the n.h.l’s return to finland, where he notched a hat trick and then another goal in a pair of games in helsinki against a fellow finn, aleksander barkov, and the rest of the florida panthers.            image     colorado avalanche right wing mikko rantanen entered wednesday fourth in the n.h.l. in scoring.   credit  nick wass/associated press         “his shooting is a work of art,” said sami salo, a former n.h.l. defenseman who now coaches in finland. “it doesn’t matter if the puck comes at a bad angle, he always seem to get a perfect shot any time.”  rantanen, the no. 10 pick in 2015, has transformed himself into one of the league’s savviest and most imaginative playmakers. with 75 points, rantanen is fourth in the n.h.l. in scoring and has combined with nathan mackinnon and gabriel landeskog to compile 206 points, tied with calgary’s top line for the most of any trio.        “he can find the passing lane even though there’s five sticks in the way,” laine said of rantanen, with whom he has trained for the past three summers. “he’s going to find a way. he’s also one of the strongest players that age that i’ve ever seen.”  two finnish players, selanne and jari kurri, have led the n.h.l. in goals during a regular season, and both are in the hall of fame. but behind selanne and kurri in career points per game by finnish players are four active members of the n.h.l., all of them under 25. they are laine, rantanen, barkov and sebastian aho of the carolina hurricanes.  young finnish defensemen are also making a mark. dallas stars defenseman miro heiskanen, the no. 3 pick in the 2017 draft, dominated in finland as a teenager and was an all-star last month in his first n.h.l. season. he has followed a path similar to that of buffalo sabres defenseman rasmus ristolainen, selected eighth in 2013.  finland’s rise is evident in international play, too. in january, the finns earned the gold medal at the world junior championship for the third time in six years, after winning it only twice in the 40 years before this run.            image        laine and the jets played two games in november in helsinki, a two-hour drive from his hometown in finland.   credit  martti kainulainen/lehtikuva, via associated press         “if you win three times in six years, that tells you something,” said rantanen, who played on the 2016 junior champions with laine, aho and toronto maple leafs winger kasperi kapanen. “it’s not only luck or just one good tournament. in finnish coaching, the level is going higher and higher. there are a lot of good, young coaches coming, and i think the biggest thing is that the coaches are trying to concentrate on individuals more than five or 10 years ago.”  neither the national team’s success nor its players’ prolific totals in the n.h.l. are coincidental. beginning in 2009, finnish officials  made considerable investments and sweeping changes  that gave greater continuity to player development. in 2014, after a disastrous under-18 world championship tournament that included a 10-0 loss to its archrival sweden, the finnish federation held a wide-ranging summit that emphasized individual skills like skating, puck-handling, shooting, balance and strength training.        “they teach us a lot about playing together, but when we’re playing together, we need all players to have good individual skills, especially skating,” said barkov, 23, an elite two-way player who averages a point per game. “hockey is getting a lot faster and more skilled.”  kurri, a former general manager of the national program, described the old model for success.  “if we didn’t have the most skilled players, we had to be a good as a team,” he said. “that’s how we could have success, for many many years. that and good goaltending, we always had a good goalie behind us.”  finland did produce  a generation of outstanding goalies , including winners of the stanley cup and the vezina trophy like miikka kiprusoff, antti niemi and tuukka rask. but now netminders have taken a back seat to skaters.  nashville predators goalie pekka rinne, 36, said that the emphasis on individual skills and the provocation of players’ imaginations through exposure to the n.h.l. has produced the most abundant and diverse crop of finns ever to emerge in pro hockey.            image        miro heiskanen, a defenseman for the dallas stars, was an all-star this season, his first in the n.h.l.   credit  tom pennington/getty images         “the finnish player type used to be the very reliable, solid, two-way player who had a very successful career, maybe on lower lines,” said rinne, who won the vezina trophy last season. “now we have these individuals coming up with amazing skill, and i feel like there’s something to that exposure and kids being able to see, copy and try on their own.”  the mind-set is changing for defensemen, too, as heiskanen and ristolainen have not only logged big minutes but have also played with flair.        “defensemen were kind of the players nobody wanted to be because you had to defend,” salo said. “you can’t score really, you have to stay back. i see a big change in the mind of youngsters who are coming up. they are fearless with the puck; they want to score all the time.”  jere lehtinen, a former dallas stars right wing and the general manager of finland’s national team, said that each win, each medal and each successful finnish n.h.l. player reinforces belief and raises expectations for successive generations. his generation, which won medals at the olympics and world championships, instilled confidence that games were winnable regardless of opponent, circumstance or score.  “nowadays these guys, these kids coming in, they just come and they know they can win,” lehtinen said. “they don’t hesitate at all, they’re not scared of losing.”  the finnish pipeline shows no signs of drying up. right wing kaapo kakko is expected to be a top 5 pick in the coming draft in june.  “it has taken a long, long

       " 'farmingdale, n.y. — as henrik stenson tried to warm up on the driving range at bethpage state park on tuesday, a crowd began to form around him.  the fans and pros were not admiring his swing as much as his hardware: stenson had brought with him the silver medal he had just won in the rio olympics. he was carrying it in his golf bag.  “i’m not one to run around and have my medal at the supermarket,” stenson said. he acknowledged, however, that the medal was there in his pocket as he spoke to reporters.  not to be outdone, justin rose, who beat stenson for the gold, said he had his medal nearby, too.  “it’s much easier to travel with than a normal trophy,” rose said. “you can just slip it in your pocket and then carry on.”        golf had not been an olympic sport since 1904. now that it is back, there seems to be a lot of fascination with the spoils.  rose, who also won the 2013 united states open at merion, pa., said he was amazed how many friends, family members and fans had asked him about his latest reward.  “everyone wants to feel the weight of it,” rose said. “that’s what’s curious about it. everyone wants to see, ‘oh, how heavy is it?’”  to pre-empt those questions, stenson decided just to bring his medal to the course at bethpage black, where the barclays tournament is being held this week. it started with a simple desire to show the silver to his putting coach, philip kenyon. but word quickly got out.        “someone on the range wanted to see it,” stenson said. “then the fans saw it. so, of course, they can have a little look.”            image     russell knox this month at the travelers championship, which he won.   credit  steven ryan/getty images         rose admitted it was a little difficult turning the page from his triumph in rio back to the regular pga tour schedule and the start of the fedex cup playoffs. but he said he hoped the momentum from his olympic victory would carry into this week.  “often we play well in runs here on tour,” rose said. “hopefully, i can put a run together myself.”  it has been an impressive summer for stenson, who won the british open in july. but the silver that he earned for his native sweden seemed to occupy a different place in his heart. he said he relished his experience in rio, from walking as part of the opening ceremony to his runner-up performance to rose, an englishman who competed for britain’s team.  “when you represent your country, you definitely feel like you’re playing for your country rather than yourself,” stenson said. “you feel proud when you succeed and bring home a medal for your country.”  rose said, “for me, it was right up there with anything i’ve achieved in the game of golf.”  and he carries the hardware around in his pocket to prove it.  “you can drink out of the claret jug,” rose said, referring to the british open trophy. “i guess the olympic gold would be a nice coaster.”   strong year for knox  tied for the lead entering the final round at the w.g.c.-hsbc champions tournament in shanghai last november, russell knox had trouble convincing himself he was good enough to win on the pga tour.        “i was terrified,” knox said. “i had no idea i was able to win such a massive tournament.”  less than a year later, knox has two career wins under his belt — he also claimed the travelers championship this month — and two runner-up finishes. that has him fourth in the fedex cup playoff standings, ahead of jimmy walker (17), henrik stenson (14), phil mickelson (8) and jordan spieth (5).  knox, a 31-year-old from scotland, said that his game had developed naturally over the course of a nine-year professional career.  “i think a lot of times out here, people try and force to improve too quickly,” knox said. “maybe try a new coach, a new this, new that, always searching for something different.”  he said he had never used a swing coach, which has allowed him to trust his swing when he really needs to.  “i’ve been very fortunate that i’ve just allowed myself to naturally improve,” knox said. “i think that’s one of the reasons i’ve had a great year. i haven’t tried to change anything.”       ',\n",

       " 'los angeles — the los angeles kings and ilya kovalchuk seemed like an ideal match when they agreed to a three-year, $18.75 million contract last summer.  kovalchuk, a high-scoring winger, had accomplished all he could in five seasons in russia, having won two professional championships, a scoring title, a world championship and an olympic gold medal. the kings were statistically the n.h.l.’s best defensive team last season but had a middling offense that lacked scoring depth.  kovalchuk’s combination of power, finesse and technical skill appealed to the kings. their accomplished, veteran nucleus attracted kovalchuk in his search to return to the n.h.l. after five seasons in russia’s kontinental hockey league.  “we never had a player quite like kovy,” said wing dustin brown, who captained the kings to stanley cups in 2012 and 2014.        kovalchuk said an olympic gold medal with russia was a motivating factor in  his return, at age 30, to his home country  after scoring more than 400 goals with the atlanta thrashers and the devils from 2001 to 2013.  soon after winning that gold medal at the pyeongchang olympics in february, kovalchuk began thinking about returning to the n.h.l. to pursue a stanley cup.  if he were to hoist the cup, he would join his fellow russian pavel datsyuk as the only player to have won a stanley cup, an olympic gold medal, a world championship and a gagarin cup, which is awarded to the k.h.l. champions.            image     kovalchuk, right, won a gold medal with the russian team at the pyeongchang olympics in february.   credit  james hill for the new york times         “he’s a good player, and of course every good player wants to play in the best league. he wanted to, not just play, he wanted to win a stanley cup,” said datsyuk, who played with kovalchuk on the russian national team and s.k.a. st. petersburg.        but if the stanley cup is the goal, the kings, at least this season, may not be much help.  plagued by a dearth of scoring, an ineffective power play, the absence of their trademark defensive doggedness and a seemingly unshakable malaise, los angeles (8-14-1) is last in the league standings.  the kings have allowed their opponent to score first in 14 of 23 games, having come back to win just once. they are the lowest scoring team in the n.h.l. and have a league-worst minus-23 goal differential. their power play improved from a league worst only after a 5-2 victory over edmonton on sunday. their penalty kill has been porous, as well as too frequently deployed. their expectations may have shifted from winning the stanley cup to pursuing the no. 1 overall pick, believed widely to be the american center  jack hughes .  los angeles has won consecutive games just once this season, and did so with different coaches at the helm: after defeating columbus on nov. 3, john stevens became the first coach to be fired this season; the kings promoted willie desjardins to head coach, and he won his debut, against anaheim on nov. 6.  kovalchuk, who nearly signed with the kings in 2010, was a positive force initially. he leads the team in multipoint games (four) and points (14). but that says more for the kings’ offensive futility than his prowess; kovalchuk has not recorded a point in his last nine games.  before kovalchuk’s slump began, datsyuk said: “since he left, hockey has changed now, and he needed to adapt a little bit. now it looks like he’s adapted. i think the further they go, the more he can help the team.”  kovalchuk played down the adjustment to the evolving n.h.l. after five seasons in russia.  “hockey is the same game wherever you play,” he said. “the rink here is smaller, so everything comes faster. all the best players play here. it’s a good challenge for me personally because you have to get out of your comfort zone sometimes to be even better. even if you’re 35, it does not matter. you can be better and learn something every day.”  kovalchuk has moved around the lineup, playing left wing and right wing at even strength, as well as both point positions on the power play, where he heated up before the coaching change. lately, though, he has been given fewer minutes and less responsibility. he has played considerably less with the top two forward lines and top power-play unit and has been used sparingly late in games. on sunday, kovalchuk logged a season-low 6 minutes 20 seconds in ice time and didn’t play a single shift in the third period.        “he is an interesting player,” desjardins told reporters. “he relies totally on offense. he’s not a huge checker. his game revolves around offense.”            image        after leaving the devils in 2013, kovalchuk won two k.h.l. championships with a st. petersburg team.   credit  alexander nemenov/agence france-presse — getty images         with center jeff carter injured for most of last season, center anze kopitar, defenseman drew doughty and brown carried the kings’ offense. but brown missed significant time because of injury this season, while doughty has shouldered considerable defensive responsibility. carter and kopitar stumbled out of the gates.  kopitar, now in his 13th n.h.l. season, has led the kings in scoring in 10 of the last 11 campaigns. last season, his 92 points were a career high, and he was a finalist for the league’s most valuable player award. this season, kopitar has produced 13 points in 23 games, including only six in his first 17. carter has 12 points this season.  in addition to brown’s injury, goalie jonathan quick has been sidelined with two injuries. jack campbell filled in admirably before he too sustained a knee injury that will force him to miss four to six weeks.  desjardins hopes to get more from the team’s peripheral scorers.  “the older group, they’ve won. they’re just warriors,” he told reporters. “they come in and play so hard, and they know it. the second group hasn’t got that yet.”  in kovalchuk, the kings may at least have a mentor for those younger players.  kings forward alex iafallo said he grew up watching kovalchuk and that he was “learning from him every day.”        columbus left wing artemi panarin played with kovalchuk for two seasons in st. petersburg, where kovalchuk mentored him. he described kovalchuk as a team-first player with impeccable training habits, strong character, unflappable confidence, sound leadership abilities and intense competitiveness.  “we would practice before our practice, then stay after our practice,” panarin said through his interpreter, vlad spektor. “after practice, we would skate for another 40 minutes. i went into the locker room afterward, and my teammates said jokingly, ‘that’s enough practice. how much more can you practice?’ ilya said, ‘the dogs bark, but the caravan moves onward.’”  kovalchuk and his wife, nikol, have situated their four children in beverly hills, where they have taken to their new surroundings even more quickly than kovalchuk began adding to his career totals.  “my wife did a great job, and everybody’s settled in and happy on the family side,” kovalchuk said. “we just have to start winning games, and it’ll be very good for everybody.”       ',\n",
       " 'perth, australia — serena williams and roger federer have athletic lives of almost parallel excellence, which will finally intersect on a tennis court tuesday.  the 37-year-olds are the only people to have won 20 or more grand slam singles titles in the open era besides steffi graf, who has won 22. williams’ 23 and federer’s 20 are the most of grand slam singles titles of any woman and man, respectively, in the open era. they have won grand slam titles on the same court on the same weekend eight times, first in 2003 and most recently in 2017. each has made comfortably more than $100 million in prize money and endorsements.  they have been headliners on posters and played consecutively on a center court many times, the two have never faced each other on a court in their decades together on tour (they did play on the same team in an exhibition match in 2010 to raise money for haiti). that will change new year’s day at the hopman cup, where federer and williams will be across the net from one another in a mixed doubles match between switzerland and the united states.  “i’ve been looking forward to it since i saw it,” williams said. “i was like, ‘oh, my god, this is so cool.’ so it’s just something that, as a player, is something that you would dream of, to play roger federer.”        australia’s channel 9 and the stateside tennis channel have billed the match as “federer vs. williams” in their graphics, leaving their respective partners belinda bencic and frances tiafoe off   advertisements for the mixed team event .            image     federer and williams have won grand slam titles on the same court on the same weekend eight times, including wimbledon in 2009, as shown here. williams has the edge in overall singles grand slams with 23 to federer’s 20.   credit  aeltc pool picture/bob martin, via european pressphoto agency         “it’s very exciting for both of us,” federer said. “i hope that a lot of tennis fans are going to tune in and watch it, because it’s going to be one time and probably never again, in this kind of a competition.”  “we’re both fierce competitors,’’ he added, “and we always want to win. we try our best.”  the hopman cup, an annual invitational that is sanctioned by the international tennis federation as its mixed team competition but does not offer ranking points or contribute to a player’s overall record, straddles a line between exhibition and official tournament. williams and federer have won it twice before but have never competed in the same year.  of her first time facing federer, williams said she was “just glad it’s not in singles.”  “listen, if there’s one thing i’ve never worried about, it’s how i would match up against roger — because i don’t think it would be very good,” williams said, laughing. “thankfully it’s something i don’t have to often think about. i’m just going to have fun tomorrow.”        the mixed doubles match will be preceded by men’s and women’s singles matches, pitting federer against tiafoe and williams against bencic. the mixed doubles match will be played in tennis australia’s abbreviated “fast 4” format, with sets played to four games, no-ad scoring and a nine-point tiebreak at 3-all.  williams is the far more pedigreed doubles player, having won 14 grand slam titles and three gold medals alongside her sister, venus, as well as two grand slam titles in mixed doubles early in her career. federer, like most top men’s players, does not play any doubles at the grand slam events, as the best-of-five singles format can prove prohibitive to additional entries. but he won a gold medal with stan wawrinka at the 2008 olympics.  williams’s coach, patrick mouratoglou, said that his focus for the week was not on her encounter with federer, but on the solo matches she will play at the tournament.  “i completely understand — it’s the two greatest players of all time,” mouratoglou said of the attention. “but i’m really focused on the singles, because my goal is that she wins the australian open.” that tournament begins jan. 14.

       " 'seoul, south korea — when the #metoo movement  started gaining traction  in south korea last year, many people looked to the country’s sports communities, which have long been dogged by  allegations of corruption  and physical abuse. but few victims spoke out.  that changed this month, when shim suk-hee, 21, a member of south korea’s national short-track speedskating team and a two-time olympic gold medalist, said she had been repeatedly raped by her former coach, cho jae-beom, since she was 17.  mr. cho, 38, was fired as national team coach shortly before the start of the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, last year on allegations of violent abuse against athletes. in september, he was sentenced to 10 months in prison for physically assaulting four athletes, including ms. shim, between 2011 and the preparations for  the pyeongchang games .  if ms. shim’s accusation of sexual assault is corroborated, it would add more weight to the long-held allegation among sports analysts that south korea’s  glory in short-track speedskating  has been built on a brutal training regimen that included beatings and other forms of violence.        allegations of abuse against elite athletes are being addressed in other countries, including the united states, where  lawrence g. nassar , a former doctor for the women’s national gymnastics team, was sentenced last year to decades in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women.  mr. cho, speaking through his lawyers, denied raping ms. shim. the police said that they had confiscated his cellphone and computers to look for criminal evidence.  ms. shim’s accusations against her former coach have sent shock waves through the country’s sports community.        image     cho jae-beom, 38, was fired as national team coach last year on allegations of violent abuse. in september, he was sentenced to 10 months in prison for assaulting athletes, including ms. shim.   credit  yonhap       south korea is particularly  proud of its short-track speedskating . the country has won 24 olympic gold medals, more than any other country, since the sport became part of the games in 1992. ms. shim herself has won more than 20 gold medals in international competitions since 2012, including a gold in the 3,000-meter team relay at the 2014 winter olympics. she won the same medal in pyeongchang.        “this unveils the humiliating underside of our country’s glorious facade as a sports powerhouse,” president moon jae-in said on monday.  mr. moon called for a thorough investigation, urging his government to help other victims feel safe enough to speak out.  his remarks came as more than 260,000 people signed  a petition  to his office demanding a longer prison term for mr. cho.  mr. moon’s government was caught off guard by ms. shim’s allegations.  only hours before ms. shim’s accusations were first reported in the local news media last tuesday, the country’s korean sport and olympic committee reported making strong progress in its campaign to protect athletes against sexual and other types of abuse. in a survey of 1,201 athletes, including all 791 national team members, the committee said it had found only four cases of sexual violence. in a similar survey in 2010, almost 27 percent of respondents reported sexual abuse.  the government said it would open a more comprehensive investigation of sexual crimes in the sports community, vowing to expel perpetrators from the field permanently and to take steps to prevent schools and other teams from hiring them.  “one of the problems has been that the perpetrators were not properly punished and they often returned to their old jobs,” vice sport minister roh tae-kang said last week.  encouraged by ms. shim’s accusations, a former judo competitor, shin yoo-yong, 24, publicly accused her former coach of having repeatedly raped her since she was a high school student. her coach once tried to silence her with a $445 payoff after his wife began suspecting him of having a sexual relationship with her, ms. shin said in a facebook post and in an  interview  with the hankyoreh newspaper, published on monday.        the police said they were investigating the case.  solidarity for young skaters, a group of current and former ice skaters and coaches, said at least two other victims planned to speak in public. other victims of sexual violence were afraid to speak out because whistle-blowers in the past had been vilified and ostracized in their profession, which is ruled by a rigid, hierarchical relationship between coaches and athletes, said the group’s leader, yeo jun-hyung, a former national team coach.        image     ms. shim outside the suwon district court, south of seoul, the capital, in december.   credit  yonhap/agence france-presse — getty images       the government’s efforts to encourage whistle-blowers by opening hotlines for victims have not worked, critics said.  “if shim suk-hee were not an olympic gold medalist, her case too could have been buried,” chung yong-chul, a professor of sports psychology at sogang university in seoul, the south korean capital, said at a news conference last week.  sports experts had long said that abuse was widespread in south korea, where winning olympic golds justified physical assaults. in south korea, athletes often live together in dormitories and routinely skip other classes, leaving them with few other career choices. such a system gives coaches exceptional power over athletes, sports commentators say.  mr. cho, who had coached ms. shim since she was in primary school, regularly inspected her cellphone to see whom she was talking to, her lawyer, lim sang-hyuk, told reporters. when she was in the fourth grade, mr. cho broke a bone in her finger with a hockey stick, mr. lim said.  ms. shim could not protest this behavior because of fears that mr. cho would end her career, mr. lim said. the coach once tinkered with ms. shim’s skate blades in a competition to favor other athletes, mr. lim added.        ms. shim’s troubles first came to public attention last january, when she left the national team training facility in the run-up to the pyeongchang games because of physical abuse.  mr. cho was quickly removed as coach after an investigation. he was briefly hired to coach the chinese national team after he was banned from working in south korea, but he later returned home to face trial.  testifying at mr. cho’s appeals trial last month, ms. shim said mr. cho used to punch and kick her until “she felt she might die” during training for the pyeongchang games. ms. shim claimed that a fall she had during a pyeongchang competition was because of a concussion she had suffered at mr. cho’s hands.  “i came here so that there will be no more victims like me,” ms. shim said.

       " 'mina guli demurs when someone has the audacity to call her a runner.  “i feel like i’m not an athlete,” she said via skype from a hotel room in shanghai. “a runner? i’m not that, either.”  she had just run a marathon that day, and was about to run another one the next day, then another the day after that, and after that. her goal: to run 100 marathons in 100 days to raise awareness of global water issues.  these are not official marathons, of course, but 26.2-mile runs that she mapped out and then documented with photos on twitter, where #runningdry became a thing in running circles.        how can she afford this?  guli, 48, is part of a class of runners now picking up sponsorships the same way top-level runners coming out of college do. they won’t be winning the boston marathon or olympic medals, but they offer something that shoe brands want to be a part of at a time when the top of the podium isn’t the only spotlight.            image     guli with supporters during a run in central park.    credit  james keivom for the new york times         guli is sponsored by reebok,  which gives her gear, a media campaign around her quest and, maybe most important of all, for the logistics of her quest, money. she is not entirely an unknown — she is the founder and chief executive of thirst, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the global water crisis — but she is hardly a social media star. her instagram account has just over 3,000 followers, a pittance in the influencer world.  in other words, reebok isn’t just throwing products at runners in exchange for pretty pictures on their instagram feeds.  rather,  reebok and other companies are going after unique narratives they hope will inspire people. they&#x27;re doing this at a time when participants are as likely to be influenced by what someone who looks like them is wearing as the runner who ends up with a gold medal.  “ultimately, they want to be able to tell a story,” said merhawi keflezighi, founder and president of hawi management, which represents athletes like his brother meb, the long-distance runner, and the paralympic sprinter jarryd wallace.  meb keflezighi was second in the olympic marathon in 2004 in athens, and won the new york city marathon in 2009 and boston in 2014. merhawi keflezighi has been an agent since 2005, and seen the types of sponsorship deals widen in that time. “people can relate to others when it’s not just the fastest person in the world or the strongest person in the world,” he said.        case in point,  justin gallegos, a runner with cerebral palsy whose video of getting a contract from nike went viral . “people admired that passion that he has for running,” merhawi keflezighi said.          gallegos first connected with nike in high school. at the university of oregon, where he ran for a club team, he worked with nike on the development of the  flyease shoe , which is designed for athletes with mobility impairments. getting the nike offer caught gallegos off guard, though he did know it was a possibility. his manager, john truax, is also a nike employee.  “i think it puts a statement on what being an athlete truly means,” gallegos said. “yes, talent is important. don’t get me wrong. but you can have all the talent in the world and not have any passion.”  gallegos is now planning to run his first marathon — he wants it to be the chicago marathon in october. he is campaigning for more runners with cerebral palsy to run longer distances at the 2020 summer paralympics in tokyo. he would like to run the 1,500-meter race, but said  that the standards for it right now are not achievable for someone with cerebral palsy.  “it’s important for these companies to expand their horizons because there’s lots and lots of talented athletes out there,” he added.  while nike and reebok assisted in arranging interviews with their athletes, neither company responded to follow-up requests to comment on why they chose to sponsor such runners.        mirna valerio, 43, started a blog called, “ fat girl running ,” in 2011 while training for her first marathon. she named it that “because i was fat and i was a girl and i ran,” she said. “it’s as simple as that. i knew that it would be a little controversial, and i was o.k. with that.”          she has since run the javelina jundred 100k in arizona and the six-day, 120-mile version of the transrockies run in colorado. she also wrote a memoir, “a beautiful work in progress.”  while none of the runners interviewed for this article would share how much these contracts were worth because of nondisclosure agreements, valerio said being sponsored was enough for her to quit her teaching job and run full time. she said she was able to do so with the financial support of merrell, skirt sports, hyland’s, swiftwick and custom performance of new york.  “she’s got a passion for being outside and testing and challenging herself and her own evolution and development of someone who’s passionate about the outdoors,” strick walker, chief marketing officer of merrell, said.  valerio said the support for nonelite runners had been a long time coming, though she understood that like all businesses, the companies were investing in everyday runners because they thought that doing so could make them money.  “they’re realizing that their bottom line can be enhanced by including more people, including different communities,” she said. “they will say it’s about inclusivity, but when you get down to it, it’s about your bottom line and market share, and you don’t want to lose market share by not being inclusive.”            image         guli was scheduled to run her 100th marathon in 100 days in new york city on feb. 11, but she fractured the

they have sponsorships or not. guli was scheduled to run her 100th marathon in 100 days in new york city on feb. 11, but  she fractured the shaft of her right femur  and could only run 62. the one in new york went on, anyway, with runners who she said had come out to raise awareness of the global water crisis, and she crossed the finish line, set up in central park, on crutches.  “i’m just a

       " 'rick nash, a no. 1 overall n.h.l. draft pick and a star for the columbus blue jackets and the rangers, has retired because of concussion-related symptoms, his agent said friday.  nash, 34, trailed only alex ovechkin and patrick marleau in career goals among active players with 437. he also had 368 assists in 1,060 career games.  “due to unresolved issues/symptoms from the concussion sustained last march, rick nash will be forced to retire from the game of hockey,” his agent, joe resnick, said in a statement. “under the advice of his medical team, the risk of further brain injury is far too great if rick returns to play.”  the columbus blue jackets selected nash, from brampton, ontario, in the 2002 draft. he entered the league at 18 and spent the first nine seasons with columbus. he remains the franchise’s career leader in goals and points. in 2012, the blue jackets traded him to the rangers, with whom he spent six seasons, and he also played 11 games with the boston bruins in 2018 after being traded there in february.        it was with the bruins that he sustained his most recent concussion, in march, though he did return for the playoffs. another concussion, with the rangers in 2013, caused him to miss six weeks.  he was a free agent entering this season but told teams at the start of free agency that he was not yet ready to play.  he led the n.h.l. in goals with 41 in 2003-4 and tallied a career-high 42 goals in 2014-15. he also won olympic gold medals with canada in 2010 and 2014.

       " 'saskatoon, saskatchewan — kendall coyne schofield abruptly gasped with delight. she held up her phone to photograph a great dane padding in the lobby of saskatoon’s delta bessborough hotel.  “my sister-in-law has the exact same-colored dog,” said coyne schofield, 26, the american women’s hockey team star.  it was a rare distraction for coyne schofield, whose eyes have been fixed on her professional and personal goals this year. a five-time world champion, she won her first olympic gold medal in february, when the united states  defeated its archrival canada, 3-2,  in a dramatic final shootout that ended the canadians’ reign as the four-time olympic champions.  coyne schofield, a 5-foot-2, 125-pound left wing, did not slow down after participating in a two-week victory tour that included stops at “the ellen degeneres show” and the new york stock exchange.        in june, she competed on “american ninja warrior.” in july, she married michael schofield, a 2016 super bowl champion with the denver broncos who is now an offensive guard for the los angeles chargers. in august, she became the first woman to play in the chicago professional hockey league, facing n.h.l. stars like patrick kane of the chicago blackhawks. in october, she was inducted into the chicagoland sports hall of fame and also became the first woman to receive the stan mikita lifetime achievement award. and her favorite ice cream shop in palos park, ill., created a flavor called the golden coyne — vanilla ice cream with cookie dough and golden oreos — to honor her olympic triumph.  “i think getting married trumps everything and anything,” coyne schofield said. “it was definitely the best day of my life to marry my best friend and continue our life together. but it has been an incredible year. it’ll be a hard one to top, for sure.”  at the four nations cup in saskatoon this month, she burnished her reputation for making big plays at big times. she scored a goal and assisted on brianna decker’s winner in the 5-2 final victory over canada, as the united states won the tournament for the fourth consecutive year.            image     coyne schofield, left, with hilary knight after the u.s. defeated its archrival canada to win the gold medal at the 2018 winter olympics.   credit  jung yeon-je/agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         coyne schofield also set up sydney brodt’s late winner in a 2-1 round-robin victory over canada and finished the tournament with five points.        “her leadership on the team is huge,” said brodt, 20, a national team newcomer. “she’s not always the loudest in the locker room, but she’s always going to do the right thing on and off the ice.”  olympic teammates hail her electrifying speed. decker called coyne schofield the connor mcdavid of the team, referring to the edmonton oilers star and n.h.l. most valuable player who is also known for his speed. to the defender kacey bellamy, coyne schofield is “the fastest woman in the world.”  coyne schofield said she had had limited opportunities to work with skating coaches, although she did receive instruction from kenny mccudden, the former skating and skills coach of the american hockey league’s chicago wolves, who now works for the columbus blue jackets.  “when i was younger, i played with the boys a lot, and it forced me to be a good skater, because i don’t have much size,” said coyne schofield, who won the 2016 patty kazmaier memorial award as the top n.c.a.a. women’s hockey player. “you had to keep up with them or get off the ice, especially when you have a ponytail coming out of your helmet.”  instead of working with a skating coach, she builds her speed in the weight room.  “i want to be the strongest player i can be,” she said. “i’m 125 pounds, but i want that to be 125 pounds of muscle. so it’s just constantly focusing on my strength. obviously a lot of lower-body strength, a lot of single-leg strength. i’ve had amazing strength coaches throughout my career, and they’ve helped me maximize my speed, and have helped me get faster on the ice.”  coyne schofield takes inspiration from cammi granato, the national women’s team’s career leading scorer, who also grew up in the chicago area. coyne schofield met granato at a hockey camp at age 7.  she said the olympic victory celebrations in south korea hit home: “i got a text from cammi offering her congratulations. i can get teary-eyed talking about it. i was 7 years old and i held her gold medal.”        granato, who captained the winning olympic team in 1998, was also known for her lobbying for equitable treatment for women’s hockey players. coyne schofield and her teammates took up that fight in 2017, announcing they were prepared to boycott the world championship. usa hockey, which had previously paid its female players only $1,000 a month for six months in an olympic season,  agreed to pay  each player $14,000 to $21,000 each year, among other concessions.            image        among the post-olympic opportunities afforded coyne schofield was “throwing out” the first pitch at a chicago white sox game in april.   credit  nam y. huh/associated press         “she’s a fiery little one in the best way,” said hilary knight, whom coyne schofield set up for the overtime gold-medal-winning goal against canada  at that world championship . “she wants what’s best for this program, what’s best for the next generation. i think that really shone through in our internal meetings.”  coyne schofield wants usa hockey to schedule more national team games, and wants women’s hockey to have greater visibility nationwide, noting that the 2018 olympic gold medal game was named best game at the espy awards.  “we have two major tournaments this season: the four nations cup and the world championship in finland,” she said. “yet there’s not one opportunity for anybody in the united states to watch us live on national television. not one. that’s a whole year that we just worked our butts off, trained hard for, and no one has the opportunity to see us play.”  currently, coyne schofield plays for the minnesota whitecaps, the latest team to join the national women’s hockey league. she has one goal and four assists for the 6-0 whitecaps.  to be with her husband, she commutes between orange county, calif., where she trains with the under-18 anaheim junior ducks boys, and chicago, where she works part-time in fan development for the blackhawks. she joins the whitecaps for weekend games, boarding with hannah brandt, her olympic teammate.        “i get, ‘well, how come you didn’t move to minnesota?’ ” coyne schofield said. “i said: ‘you’re paying me $7,000. i’m not moving to minnesota.’ if this league was more sustainable, i would consider it. but i’m not moving away from my family for that amount of money. whereas if i was making $100,000, ‘see you, honey, in a few months!’ you know? he would obviously have the utmost support and respect for that decision.”  coyne schofield said she hoped player salaries would eventually approach $100,000 if the five-team n.w.h.l. and the six-team canadian women’s hockey league merged.  her time playing in the chicago pro hockey league with n.h.l. players over the summer showed her how much work needs to be done in her sport and whom she is doing it for.  “it was an awesome experience to see all these young girls in the stands,” coyne schofield said. “and i may be biased, but i don’t think they were there to see the boys!”       ',\n",
       " 'it is not true that mikaela shiffrin has won every ski race she has entered this winter. it just seems that way.  shiffrin has won so often, in fact, that when she skips a race, or two, it spawns a minor contretemps.  in sweden last week, shiffrin won her fourth gold medal at the world ski championships with a breakthrough victory in the super-g. but she also bypassed another event, the alpine combined, where she would have been the favorite.  afterward, two of skiing’s superstars, lindsey vonn and bode miller, both of whom shiffrin idolized as a child, questioned her decision not to race.        “she could have won everything,” vonn told the associated press. “i’m a racer and i want to race in every single race that i possibly can.”  vonn, who in the final event of her career sunday was third in the women’s downhill, added: “so i don’t personally understand it.”  miller, too, said that he would like to see shiffrin race more often.  “but it’s different strokes different folks,” miller said.  shiffrin, in a telephone interview on sunday from norway, where she has been training for this week’s giant slalom and slalom races at the world championships, said her race choices were part of a meticulous plan.  “i would love to race in every single race; there’s always that temptation,” said shiffrin, who has won 14 times this season, including victories in 12 of her last 15 races. “but i have to do what my body can handle — to go to the limit, but not beyond it.”        this less-is-more approach was born during last year’s pyeongchang olympics, she said, when she was a contender in as many as five events and won two medals, a gold and a silver.  that showing was certainly not a disappointment, but a condensed event schedule brought on by weather delays left shiffrin fatigued and overwrought.  “the olympics in korea, and the weeks leading up to it, were a huge learning lesson,” shiffrin, 23, said. “it’s always in the back of my mind. there are a lot of athletes who race in everything, but they get to a point where they’re just exhausted and kind of burned out.”  shiffrin related an exchange she had in 2014 with tina maze, the now retired slovenian alpine champion who that year set the record for most overall world cup points with a grueling, race-intensive schedule.  “after the last races, tina looked me in the eye and said: ‘don’t do this,’” shiffrin said. “i considered her an inspiration and i wanted to do what she did one day. she said, ‘this one season alone may ruin me.’ and i’ve never forgotten that.”  one of shiffrin’s coaches, mike day, recognizes that some in the ski community want to see shiffrin race more often.  “i fully understand that from an entertainment standpoint they want to see her compete,” day said in a telephone interview on sunday. “but the results have clearly shown that this approach is the right approach for her.”        shiffrin, who for most of her career specialized in the shorter, technical events of giant slalom and slalom, has dramatically branched out this season with stunning, impressive performances in the more daredevil super-g, which is considered a speed event along with the downhill.  shiffrin won the first super-g of her career dec. 2 in alberta, canada, and has since gone undefeated in the event, a win streak she extended to four races with her world championship victory last week. shiffrin also leads the season-long world cup point standings in giant slalom, slalom and super-g.  she has a nearly insurmountable lead in the chase for the women’s overall world cup title, which she has won the last two seasons. her 56 world cup victories are the fifth most in history (they are 30 short of the record by ingemar stenmark of sweden, who retired in 1989 a month before his 33rd birthday.)  day said shiffrin has competed in almost every race that her team of coaches, which includes jeff lackie and shiffrin’s mother, eileen, expected her to enter when the plan for 2018-19 was devised in october. shiffrin has remained on schedule despite a minor back injury first sustained in december.  “we’re managing it,” shiffrin said of the injury. “i think everybody races with some kind of pain.”  over all, shiffrin called this season the most enjoyable of her career and for that she credited a conversation she had last summer with roger federer. at functions where the two have appeared, shiffrin said federer told her that he wished he had spent more time during his prime relishing the victories instead of remaining doggedly focused on the next match or tournament.  shiffrin has been known to remain fixated in a competitive bubble rather than commemorating her accomplishments as they occur.  or, as day said: “a year ago, we ranked the worst in the world when it came to celebrating victories.”        shiffrin said that has changed.  “we go out and have a nice team dinner,” she said. “we laugh about the day. i think keeping things more lighthearted has actually led to more success.  “we’ll talk about what went well before getting into nitpicking the things i could have done better.”  shiffrin chuckled.  “we’ll still do that the next day,” she said. “but we enjoy the race first.”       ',\n",
       " 'aspen, colo. — sitting in her hotel room here tuesday night, lindsey vonn assessed the last four injury-filled years, during which she has torn three knee ligaments, sustained three leg fractures and severely broken her right arm.  vonn’s return late this season has recently been productive, but she is 17th in the season-long chase for the world cup overall title, a championship she won four times from 2008 to 2012. the reason is as old as time: a younger, unscarred generation is competing to overtake her.  vonn, however, is rising up in defiance, vowing to race through 2019.  “i feel the new wave coming,” said vonn, who finished second in the downhill here wednesday at the world cup finals.  she added: “but i’m not ready to get off the wave yet. i’m going to keep riding it out.”  winning another medal at the 2018 winter olympics — she won gold and bronze medals at the 2010 vancouver games but sat out the 2014 games in sochi with an injury — has always been vonn’s chief goal, but she recently opted to add a year to her career.        “i decided to go until 2019 at the world championships last month,” vonn said, explaining that she was disappointed by her results there: she did not finish the super-g, was fifth in the alpine combined and finished third in the downhill.  “i don’t want to go out mediocre; i want to go on top,” said vonn, whose 77 world cup victories are the most by any woman. “i wasn’t in position to do my best, and that is not how i operate.”  a  devastating crash during training in november  splintered her humerus and required vonn to have reconstructive surgery, limiting her to just eight days of training so far this season.  “i didn’t think it would be that hard to race without much training, because i’ve been skiing for a long time,” said vonn, who smiled and added, “but it turns out it’s harder than that.        “i didn’t have the same speed and consistency,” she said. “and i couldn’t prepare my equipment like i usually do.”  for the last several years, vonn has been told to temper her aggressiveness and intensity during training to avoid injuries, which have mounted as she ages. but following such advice can be a double-edged sword for vonn, because her success has been built on fearlessly taking the most daring paths on a racecourse. she often trains with men, who typically choose the riskiest tactics, and she is among the few women who race on skis designed for men.  vonn did make a concession last summer in skipping one of the united states ski team’s training camps, to minimize the chance of injury. still, just a few months later, she took a nasty tumble during a routine preseason run at copper mountain in colorado and broke her arm.  “i don’t know what i could have done differently at copper,” she said tuesday. “it was just an unlucky thing.”  but the spill shook her deeply, leaving her with nerve damage that has taken the feeling from her right hand.  “the arm injury scared me more than any other injury i’ve had,” vonn said. “i was told there was a large chance i would have permanent damage. with my knee or leg surgeries, they repaired it, i rehabbed it, and i came back. i just worked extra hard at it.        “but this was not mind over matter. no matter how hard i was telling my hand to work, it’s not working.”            image     vonn crossing the finish line wednesday at the downhill world cup event in aspen, colo.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         vonn said she did not wonder if it was worth it, or prudent, to resume racing, although she said her father expressed his concerns.  “most of my family understands how much i love what i do,” she said. “they know i’m not going to listen to them tell me to retire.”  she probably gave family members more to worry about with falls on wednesday and thursday. first, she flopped to the snow after the finish line on wednesday and skidded partway under the wall of plastic banners that separates racers from the officials, news media personnel and fans. vonn was extricated and gingerly walked away, uninjured. on thursday, she crashed in the super-g but rose to ski through the finish and wave to the grandstand.  “i was so tired; i was dead,” she said with a giggle about her wednesday collapse. “i should get some style points for that, because i was under there wrapped up tight like a burrito.”  vonn, who made her world cup debut when she was 16, has been eager lately to display her comedic side. perhaps it comes with being one of the circuit’s elders.  in her hotel tuesday, for example, she referred to the generational gap she sees when she surveys the field at the start of races and laughed.        “some of the girls were born in 2000,” she said. “that’s when i started on the world cup.”  as vonn spoke, it was 16 hours before the downhill race, which ended with her 130th world cup podium finish.  “the competition is getting crazy young,” she said. “but i’m not retiring yet.”       ',\n",

       " 'melbourne, australia — after bowing out of the australian open this week, jack sock and his childhood friend and doubles partner, jackson withrow, ended up on opposite sides of a great divide.  withrow’s childhood dream was to play professional tennis; doubles proved to be his only portal.  sock, the world’s second-ranked doubles player, has an olympic gold medal from 2016 that he won in the mixed event, which led to his being honored at a university of nebraska football game and throwing a ceremonial first pitch at a kansas city royals baseball game.  in addition, he shares four grand slam titles, three in doubles and the other in mixed.  sock, 26, has also climbed as high as no. 8 in singles, which is where he stood last year at this time. his ranking since has tumbled to 105, but singles remains no. 1 in his heart.  “i can personally say if i’m not relevant in the singles world and my only choice is to play doubles, i’d probably stop playing tennis,” sock said.        doubles is supposed to be the harmonic expression of tennis, but at the australian open, the doubles court has become the receptacle for petty grievances and philosophical divergences. it started with bernard tomic accusing his countryman and davis cup captain, lleyton hewitt, of  a litany of leadership failures , including writing himself into the lineup for davis cup.  then dan evans, the 189th-ranked singles player, fanned the flames in his native britain by describing doubles players as athletes “who didn’t make it at singles and people who didn’t have the attitude to work hard enough to make it in the singles game.”  jamie murray, ranked seventh in doubles, dismissed evans’s comments as “lazy” and “just total nonsense” and said, “we should be celebrating any success we have in the sport — doubles, mixed doubles, wheelchairs, whatever.”  the australian open is called the happy slam, but the crankiness quotient at this one has been high — as if everybody woke up on the wrong side of 2019. the men’s tour appears to be a house divided over the future of the atp president and chief executive, chris kermode, who some believe should be removed from office. the women have complained that the men do not support gender equity. the men fell in line behind an exasperated rafael nadal, who said at a news conference, “i don’t know why you are trying all the time to create these kinds of stories on this thing.”            image     sock, left, and mike bryan celebrated winning the atp world tour finals in london in november. while sock won about $1.3 million playing doubles last year, and $738,747 playing singles, he said he’d quit the game if he became irrelevant in singles.   credit  will oliver/epa, via shutterstock         on wednesday, the tournament’s 10th day, there was harmony, at least in the stands of rod laver arena. during a changeover in the australian samantha stosur’s semifinal victory with zhang shuai against barbora strycova and marketa vondrousova, the village people blared from the speakers and even the chair umpire got in the act of forming the letters in y.m.c.a.        by the tournament’s stretch run, all of australia was celebrating doubles since the men’s, women’s, mixed and wheelchair finals included at least one native son or daughter. (an australian hasn’t won a singles title here since 1978.) but no amount of success will sway sock to embrace doubles exclusively.  sock, who played most of last year with mike bryan because bryan’s twin, bob, was nursing a hip injury, won two majors and about $1.3 million playing doubles and $738,747 while compiling a 9-21 record in singles. he finished 17th over all in atp prize money despite ranking outside the top 100 in singles.  “it’s not just singles that you can make a career from in tennis,” said murray, who has six grand slam titles to his brother andy’s three in singles. “it’s important for a lot of young kids to know that growing up. it’s not easy to make it in the tennis world. there are only a few people that can make a really good living from the game. the journey is incredibly long. however you get there, whether it’s singles or doubles or whatever, there’s options there for you.”  with four career singles titles, including three in 2017, sock would appear to have more options than most. but he doesn’t see it that way.  ryan harrison, who teamed with sam querrey to beat sock and withrow in the round of 16 this week, said: “jack doesn’t want to feel discredited for his singles ability because of his dominance in doubles. and a lot of time his success in doubles overshadows him as a top-10 singles player. he’s going, ‘i’ve been 8 in the world in singles, and people are talking about me like a doubles guy.’ that perception is always going to be difficult for him.”  as long as the stigma persists that doubles players are lesser than singles players, the socks of the sport are going to have a strong incentive to stick to singles. harrison said he has tried to appeal to sock’s vanity.        “i’ve told him it’d give him more confidence in singles if he took more pride in literally being the most dominant doubles player,” harrison said. “he feels like he’s being viewed as someone not capable of playing singles.”  mike bryan said he hated to hear sock would sooner leave the sport than stick to doubles.  “when he gets out on the doubles court, he has a blast,” bryan said. “and because of doubles, he’s played in some of the biggest stadiums in the world, he’s won a gold medal, he’s been honored at a nebraska football game. what’s the harm in all of that?”       ',\n",
       " 'rio de janeiro — the united states women’s basketball team completed another impeccable journey through the olympics on saturday, winning its sixth straight gold medal and not letting a single opponent stay close over the course of four quarters.  spain was the last team standing in the way, but the game was never really a contest. the united states pulled away for a 101-72 victory, although spain could console itself that the final margin — 29 points — was closer than the 103-63 loss the americans hung on spain in the preliminary round.  then again, the scores in almost all the other games the americans played in rio were lopsided, too. on the way to the gold, they beat senegal, 121-56; serbia, 110-84; canada, 81-51; china, 105-62; and japan, 110-64.  only the semifinal game, a victory over france, had the semblance of competitiveness, with the americans ahead by just 4 points at halftime. but even the final score in that game, 86-67, was not particularly close.        “i’m pretty sure we demonstrated that we’re one of the best teams ever,” said sue bird, the veteran point guard, who sat out the game against france with a knee injury but returned to the lineup on saturday.  “we need to be on the wheaties box,” chimed in one of her teammates, angel mccoughtry.  and there was praise for the americans from the spanish players they had overwhelmed. “they are so good,” lucila pascua said. “they don’t miss any shots.”  silvia domínguez added: “i think when they are born, they just have the ball in their hands. or something like that.”         rounding the bend in rio     12 photos  view slide show  ›          image          james hill for the new york times      the americans have not lost a game in the olympics since 1992, when they fell in the semifinals to a team representing the splintered remains of the soviet union and ended up with the bronze medal.        the women’s dominant run to gold in rio stands in contrast with what the united states men’s team has experienced here. despite the presence of players like kevin durant, klay thompson and kyrie irving, the men have encountered some turbulence, winning several close games, which led to speculation that the team might be vulnerable. the american men will play their gold medal game on sunday against serbia, which they beat by only 3 points in the preliminary round.  the american women, however, do not engage in close calls. their roster, which is filled with players who have a gold-plated university of connecticut pedigree — bird, diana taurasi, tina charles, maya moore and breanna stewart — is just too much for the opposition.  that roster is not particularly young, however, with six of the 12 american players age 30 or older. but it is extremely experienced in olympic competition. nine of the 12 players had already won gold medals before saturday, and three — bird, taurasi and tamika catchings — had three apiece. now those three have four.  a good part of the crowd at saturday’s game was looking for something other than a blowout and became excited when spain stayed even with the americans in the first part of the game.  but taurasi hit consecutive 3-pointers in the second quarter as the united states started to pull away. at halftime, the score was 49-32. at the end of the third quarter, it was 81-49, and that included a halfcourt shot that domínguez nailed at the buzzer.  as the fourth quarter ended, part of the crowd chanted, “u.s.a., u.s.a.” n.b.a. commissioner adam silver, sitting courtside with thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee, applauded. on the sideline, taurasi sought out geno auriemma, her coach at connecticut and her coach at the last two olympics, and gave him a long hug.  they have won it all wherever they have been together, and auriemma was effusive in praising her.  “she and i have been through a lot of games and a lot of championships,” he said at a news conference after the game. “i told her, ‘i wouldn’t be here without you.’ i really mean that.”  taurasi is 34, a year younger than bird, and the same age as lindsay whalen, who also had a strong game on saturday in the backcourt. catchings is 37. it may be that none of them are on the roster for the 2020 summer games in tokyo, and they would all be missed. but until it is proved otherwise, the americans are a team that cannot be beaten.

       " 'jack kirrane , who was the youngest player on the united states olympic men’s hockey team in 1948 and, 12 years later, the team’s oldest member and captain when it captured america’s first gold medal in that sport, died on sept. 26 in quincy, mass. he was 86.  the cause was complications of alzheimer’s disease, his son, john, said.  kirrane (pronounced kih-rain) held an arcane sports record: the longest span between appearances on united states olympic hockey teams.  he was 17 and just a year out of high school when he made the squad that was sent to st. moritz, switzerland, in 1948 and finished fourth with a 5-3 record.  he missed the 1952 games because he had been drafted by the army, and thought he was ineligible in 1956 because he had played briefly in the eastern amateur hockey league. but he returned as a defenseman for the united states team in squaw valley, calif., four years later, when he was 29.        the 1960 squad, consisting mostly of college-age players, became the first american team to defeat the soviet union and trounced czechoslovakia, 9-4, in the last game of a round-robin series to win the gold medal. (olympic hockey used a round-robin format in the final round of play at the time and did not have final or semifinal games until 1992.) it was the only american team to go undefeated and untied.  to get to squaw valley, kirrane took a four-month unpaid leave from the brookline fire department in massachusetts and sold his pickup truck to pay for the airfare.  the 1960 upset by the american team was recalled in a 2009 documentary as the  “forgotten miracle”  — the title alluding by contrast with what was hailed as the  “miracle on ice”  20 years later, when the united states defeated the perennially powerful soviet union at the winter games in lake placid, n.y., before going on to capture the gold medal.            image     kirrane, near left, helped goaltender jack mccartan defend the net against aleksandr almetov in a u.s. win over the soviet union.   credit  bettmann         kirrane’s last encounter with competitive hockey was in 1963, when he played on the united states team at the world championships.        he served 38 years as a firefighter in brookline, retiring as a lieutenant in 1990, and 15 years as the rink manager for the bright hockey center at harvard university.  john joseph kirrane jr. was born on aug. 20, 1930, in brookline, the son of john sr., a police captain, and the former katherine cleary.  both olympic hockey teams that kirrane competed on provided their share of drama. in 1948, the united states team became embroiled in a dispute over what constituted an amateur player, and at one point was ruled ineligible for medals. (it did not win one anyway.)  in 1960, some players threatened to quit when  the coach, jack riley , recruited extra firepower at the last minute and removed other players from the team to make room. (one of the players cut was herb brooks, who went on to coach the 1980 team.)  kirrane “told the team that if he had to go to squaw valley alone, he’d do it,” his teammate, dick rodenhiser, told the boston globe.  “that put everybody back on the same page,” rodenhiser added.  in addition to his son, kirrane is survived by two daughters, susan j. fields and kristin greymont; two brothers, william and edward; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. his wife, the former patricia rose, died in 2010. he lived in brookline.  after the 1960 olympics, kirrane said that he had been inspired by his sister, evelyn, who had been stricken with polio while studying for her doctorate at harvard, forcing her to take longer to earn her degree.  “i waited 12 years to be an olympic winner,” kirrane said, “but what my sister did in eight years was far greater.”       ',\n",
       " 'rio de janeiro — the last hope for cameroon to win a 2016 olympic medal arrived in the wrestling arena on thursday night in the stern and determined form of annabel laure ali, a 31-year-old who would vie for a bronze in the women’s freestyle competition. gladiatorial rock music blasted from loudspeakers as ali walked to the mat a few feet behind her opponent, ekaterina bukina of russia.  it had been a tough olympics for this central african nation of 22 million. the news media in cameroon belittled the performance as “operation zero medals.” by thursday, at 5 p.m., only ali could save the country from an olympic shutout.  “i win, i lose,” she had said in an interview about pressure a few hours earlier. “i don’t want to regret after.”  for all their egalitarian aspirations, embodied by the parade in the opening ceremony, the olympics are a highly lopsided affair. through saturday afternoon, the five most victorious countries had claimed nearly 40 percent of all the medals, and the top 10 owned about 55 percent.        most countries — more than 120 as of friday — go home with nothing. for them, the games are not so much about tallying up glories as staving off embarrassment. and for this sizable contingent, there is a huge difference between zero medals and one.            rio olympics results 2016  here is a breakdown of all the medals awarded and the athletes who have competed at each olympics, starting with the 1896 games in athens. the schedule for the games in rio de janeiro and all the medal winners there are also listed.       consider what happened last week with austria. it is a winter sports powerhouse, but when the rio games began, it was in the midst of a summer games medal drought.  the problem started at the 2012 london olympics, when the country failed to take home so much as a bronze. the minister of sport at the time, norbert darabos, went to england during this debacle and denounced his country’s athletes as “olympic tourists.” he promised a new law that would focus funding on the most promising sports.  “we have to change the structures in time so that we can win medals in rio in 2016,” he fumed in a 2012 interview, “or else we will again be on the same level as luxembourg. they won’t win anything in london, either.”        the upshot was “projekt rio,” a program funded with 20 million euros (about $22.5 million).  it quickly looked like a waste of money. on the first full day of competition, a well-regarded judo fighter lost in just 27 seconds. the beach volleyball team was knocked out by the cubans. there were injuries and weak performances. a sailing duo in the 49er class that seemed poised for greatness failed to make the medal race.  headlines at home were hostile. “olympic debacle! we live in the stone age,” wrote kronen zeitung. österreich went with “europe laughs at our olympic tourists,” and got personal and pithy with this one: “you are embarrassing!”  when day 13 rolled around, all of austria’s remaining chances resided with three sailing teams. two of them came up short. the last of the races that day was the final in the mixed nacra 17, a catamaran operated by a man and woman. (hence “mixed.”) tanja frank and thomas zajac, the very blond austrian nacra 17 team, were hardly considered one of the country’s more promising medal threats at the start of the games.            image     austria’s thomas zajac, left, and tanja frank in the mixed nacra 17 sailing race. they won bronze, the only medal won at rio by their country, a winter powerhouse.   credit  bernat armangue/associated press         “we were really not in the small circle of favorites,” zajac said thursday night. he was sitting on a sofa on the roof of austria house, an event dining room for invited guests as well as party headquarters for brazilians who want to stop by and dance outside to a disc jockey. “there were three or four favorites and then five or six that were in the hunt. we were one of those five or six.”  they belonged in the circle of favorites, it turned out. sailing has a complex system of scoring that factors in previous performances, but as soon as the pair crossed the finish line, they knew they had won bronze. so they did something that seems hard to imagine: they jumped into the water.  “you win a medal, and you don’t really care about the water,” said zajac, 30, his nose sunburned. “you feel like you’ve survived everything.”        the news media in austria announced that the national summer medal drought had ended after exactly 2,923 days. christian kern, the country’s chancellor, posted an exultant note on facebook. the pair received hundreds of emails, texts and messages. frank, who until wednesday had only been asked about her i.q., which has been reported to exceed 155, was finally asked about something else.  “the next day,” she said, “we were on the cover of every newspaper in austria.”  life for the national olympic committee’s spokesman, wolfgang eichler, has since improved, too. the notion of leaving rio empty-handed, of another four years of drought counting, was hard to contemplate. a single bronze does not exactly represent a turnaround. “but now it’s easier to do my work,” eichler said. “it’s not as though now is all good, but at least we’re celebrating a medal.”  at the olympic wrestling venue, ali was trying do for cameroon what frank and zajac had done for austria. the match was the only close one of the night. at 4 minutes 17 seconds, ali grabbed one of bukina’s legs and forced her to hop backward and out of the ring, tying the score at 3-3.            decisive moments at the rio olympics, frame by frame  see the summer games in a series of composite images.       the seconds ticked down. ali lunged again for bukina’s legs, missing this time, then dropped to one knee and lunged again. but bukina twisted just enough to deflect ali, who wound up on both knees. when bukina swung around and grabbed her by the waist, she won 2 points. it happened at 5:58.  two seconds later, the match was over. ali and cameroon were out of the olympics. it happened so fast that even bukina seemed stunned.  ali passed through the interview zone without speaking, looking exhausted and inconsolable. but on her way out of the arena, she stopped to speak to a french reporter. “i could taste the bronze,” she told him.        “she is to be celebrated, of course,” said her coach, dieudonné ebouele motto. “because in all our delegation, she is the only one to have done something like this.”  motto was speaking in french, through a volunteer interpreter named davide adams, who happened to be from cameroon. she has a radiant smile, but even as it flashed, over and over, she said she wanted to cry.  “so close,” she said, writhing a little. “did you see how close it was? it was like she was going to win and then suddenly, she didn’t. i can’t believe it. oh my god. i can’t believe it.”  the cosmic unfairness of the games then started to bother her.  “the u.s. gets all the medals,” she said, finding the seam between outrage and amusement. “what’s wrong with you? why don’t you share?”       ',\n",
       " 'when corey cogdell-unrein of the u.s. olympic team won a bronze medal in women’s trap shooting, the chicago tribune left out a key detail when it shared the   news : her name. it described her only as the wife of a bears lineman.  the olympic games in rio are taking place during a year when americans seem to be hypervigilant about how women are covered by the media. so the reaction to the tribune’s alert was swift.  “congrats to that bears lineman who apparently deserves all the credit here,” an observer wrote on twitter.  another offered a counterpoint: “to me, it’s a city paper offering a frame of reference. they’re not writing articles about every medal winner.”        the sarcastic reply: “but what does her dad do? or her brother? i need to know more about this olympian’s male relatives!”  and so the conversation has played out since the news media arrived in rio. verbal offenses that look like sexism are called out almost daily by readers and viewers.  in this case, the online reaction was so swift, and the flood of comments so intense, that cogdell-unrein said in  an interview  with the boston radio station wbur that it took her some time to understand the uproar.  “it didn’t come off to me as something that was intentional or malicious,” she said. “i just kind of thought, ‘well, you know, they probably could’ve chosen a better heading to alert people of my victory.’ ”        (the chicago tribune has  since apologized .)            image     athletes ran past cameras in the women’s 3000-meter steeplechase round 1 in rio. researchers looked at the differences in sports-related coverage of men and women.     credit  antonin thuillier/agence france-presse — getty images.         cracking the gender code in language about athletes  the headline about cogdell-unrein is likely to be added to the  160 million english language words from the past 30 years or so  that have been logged by researchers at cambridge university press. they are studying the differences in the ways people speak about male and female olympians, and how those words might influence gender attitudes toward athletes.  sarah grieves, a researcher on the cambridge team, said in an interview that the word “man” has generally been used roughly three times as much as the word “woman” in sports-related coverage, despite the fact that women make up some 45 percent of athletes competing.  this happens even as women dominate nbc’s prime-time television coverage.  according to an analysis released sunday by three scholars who are working on a book, “olympic television: inside the biggest show on earth,” female athletes received 58.5 percent of prime-time media coverage during the first half of the games, compared with 41.5 percent for men.  the shift continues a trend that began at the 2012 london games, when women received 55 percent of coverage.  this is attributed in part to the intense focus on five sports in prime-time where american women dominate — beach volleyball, diving, gymnastics, swimming and track and field. the u.s. women’s olympic teams took home more medals than american men in 2012, and efforts by athletes katie ledecky, simone manuel and simone biles this year have kept the focus on female athleticism.  the increased media coverage might be the reason for the increased scrutiny on why the words used to describe the women are still very different from those used to describe their male counterparts.  “we found things like men being described as fastest, strong, biggest,” ms. grieves said. “for women, it’s unmarried, married, references to their age. there is an inequality there.”        the cambridge research team will soon deliver a new analysis based on what it found in rio during this year’s games.  “it’s really hard to tell whether the language used is sexist or whether it’s isolated examples that people are picking up on,” ms. grieves said of the coverage so far. “it feels like there have been a lot.”            image        michael phelps won a gold medal in the men’s 200-meter individual medley swimming final. a headline gave another phelps victory, for a silver medal, precedence over a gold won by the swimmer katie ledecky.   credit  doug mills/the new york times          a u.s. first, and the usual for jamaica     17 photos  view slide show  ›          image             doug mills/the new york times      so, has the olympics coverage been sexist?  a lot of people seem to think so.  what happened to cogdell-unrein is only one example that has drawn complaints from the audience of kibitzers online.  marie hardin, a dean of communications at penn state university and a longtime researcher of the portrayal of women in sports, said the coverage has been mixed.  “it’s been in the interest of nbc and the other major media outlets to highlight the strong performances of female athletes,” ms. hardin said. “there has been a great deal of coverage that has featured women accurately, as strong, athletic competitors.”        still, ms. hardin has noticed that a handful of comments made by commenters have fallen squarely into the sexism category.  the instances have been so frequent that news sites have  been able to build lists  of the most boneheaded examples, citing, for instance, the moment when andy murray was praised by the bbc presenter john inverdale.  mr. inverdale mentioned that murray was the first person ever to win two olympic tennis gold medals. murray  corrected him  by citing the williams sisters: “i think venus and serena have won about four each.”  ( the bbc has defended mr. inverdale , calling the comment a “simple error.”)  in another well-publicized example,  viewers were unsettled  by the nbc announcer dan hicks’s decision to praise the hungarian swimmer  katinka hosszu’s  husband after she won a gold medal.  hicks called her coach and husband, shane tusup, “the guy responsible” for her turnaround as a swimmer.  later mr. hicks  told  the associated press: “it is impossible to tell katinka’s story accurately without giving appropriate credit to shane.”  another example: a headline published by  the bryan-college station eagle , a local newspaper with a daily circulation of about 20,000 in texas, made a silver medal victory by michael phelps the top headline of its sports section, with a subheading about a world record set by ledecky. the angry response online gave the headline a much bigger audience.          kelly brown, the newspaper’s editor, wrote in an email on thursday that a copy editor had chosen the headline based on phelps being “the most decorated olympic athlete of all time.”  brown noted that a photo of ledecky appeared above the headline to illustrate the story, and provide balance.  “that’s a constant challenge for copy editors,” she wrote, “to juggle editing, rewriting, designing, finding photos and graphs to accompany stories, checking facts, writing headlines and proofing.”  beyond the pool, there was a gaffe by nbc’s al trautwig, who saw sanne wevers of the netherlands writing in a notebook after completing her balance beam routine. he wondered if  wevers might’ve been writing in her diary .  luckily, there was a woman around to explain: the retired gymnast and current olympics analyst nastia liukin told mr. trautwig that wevers was likely using the notebook to calculate her scores.  “it may not be that people are deliberately trying to infantilize women,” ms. grieves, the cambridge researcher, said of examples like this, but the criticism is “kind of bringing to light people who don’t even realize they’re doing it.”        ms. hardin said that the journalists who are brought out every two years to cover women’s olympic sports are out of practice because of the general lack of prime-time demand for sports that feature women: “it’s like asking an athlete to go on a field and demonstrate technique without practicing.”  she added: “if we really want to entirely address the sexism that seeps into olympic coverage, we need to take a hard look at how we do with coverage of female athletes between the games. that’s the much bigger issue. and i would argue that there is plenty of sexism there.”       ',\n",
       " 'usain bolt is no longer a triple-triple olympic gold medalist.  bolt and the jamaican team have been stripped of their 4x100-meter relay gold medal from the beijing games in 2008 because one runner, nesta carter, was found guilty of a doping violation,  the international olympic committee said on wednesday .  bolt won the 100 meters, the 200 and the 4x100 relay at the last three summer olympics, for a total of nine gold medals, tied for the most of any track athlete.  carter initially tested negative after  the race in 2008 . but his sample was  one of many  retested by the i.o.c. last year. it was found to contain a prohibited stimulant, methylhexaneamine.  carter’s lawyer told reuters on wednesday that he intended to file an appeal of the ruling to the court of arbitration for sport.        olympic officials last year intensified scrutiny of samples from past olympics after russia was found to have executed  an elaborate, state-supported doping scheme . dozens of athletes from the beijing and london games have been found, upon retesting of their stored samples, to be guilty of doping violations. many were medalists.  it is standard practice for olympic officials to store urine samples for up to a decade so they may conduct additional tests, often with more advanced, newly developed techniques.  carter was also a part of the winning 4x100 relay team in london in 2012, but no announcement about the status of that medal has been made.  the i.o.c. directed the international track federation to “modify the results” of the 2008 event. trinidad, japan and brazil were second, third and fourth in the race and would each move up a notch. the united states dropped the baton in its heat and did not make the final.        the i.o.c. also told the jamaican federation to secure the return of the physical gold medals. the other two team members in the final were asafa powell and michael frater. the jamaican team finished in 37.10 seconds, which was a world record at the time.  when one member of a team tests positive, it is typical for the entire team to be stripped of its medals, although there have been exceptions. marion jones lost two relay medals from 2000 after doping violations, but her teammates were allowed to keep theirs after an appeal to the court of arbitration for sport.  when news of carter’s positive test first emerged last year, bolt  told the guardian , “it’s heartbreaking because over the years you’ve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion – but it’s just one of those things.”  he added, “if i need to give back my gold medal, i’d have to give it back; it’s not a problem for me.”  the i.o.c. also announced on wednesday that tatiana lebedeva of russia was disqualified from the 2008 long jump, in which she won the silver medal, and the triple jump because of a positive test.  bolt, regarded as the greatest sprinter in history, has said he will retire from the sport after this summer’s world championships in london.

       " 'rio de janeiro — something is different about the medal ceremonies at the olympics this year: the flowers are gone.  usain bolt was handed flowers in 2012. the magnificent seven gymnasts got them in 1996. ben johnson got them in 1988, before he was disqualified.  but instead of the traditional bouquet along with their medals, michael phelps and those who manage to finish in the top three of their events at this year’s summer games are getting small sculptures of the rio 2016 logo.  flowers are “not very sustainable,” said christy nicolay, the executive producer of the victory ceremonies, who is working on her eighth olympics. “we give it to an athlete, and very often they just throw it away.”        despite the talk of sustainability, the sculptures are made of resin, polyresin and pvc.  organizers are fond of pointing out that the logo of the rio games has been designed in three dimensions for the first time, so the idea of a representation of it as a gift for the athletes seemed natural.  more care is taken over every aspect of the medal ceremony than might be expected. even the design of the trays that hold the medals is considered carefully, nicolay said.         running, rowing and riding     18 photos  view slide show  ›          image          doug mills/the new york times      the international olympic committee has a strict protocol for the ceremony but allows local tweaking for each games. in athens, for example, winners were crowned with laurel wreaths in a nod to the ancient games.  nicolay said that starting with salt lake city, the i.o.c. agreed to switch the order of presentation from gold, silver, bronze to bronze, silver, gold, to make it less anticlimactic.        making changes, even ones seemingly as small as that, required a “huge committee” and was “not easy,” she said.  another change this year is that there are three different musical pieces accompanying the ceremonies, rather than one.  the tunes, composed especially for the games, are labeled “traditional,” for events like swimming and gymnastics; “popular,” for events like basketball; and “cool,” for events like bmx and mountain biking.  beth lula, the brand director of the organizing committee, said that “nature was preserved in the ceremony in other ways.” for example, flowers decorate the podiums. but she said the three-dimensional logos were something with more permanence. “it’s something for the athletes to remember brazil,” she said.  “michael phelps can show them to his grandchildren,” she added.

       " 'farmingdale, n.y. — rory mcilroy did not watch much of the golf during the olympics. he did not watch much of anything. he spent a week at an isolated cabin in upstate new york, where there was no electricity.  adam scott traveled around europe, where golf did not air until well after he fell asleep. jason day watched one hole. then he flipped the channel to see usain bolt and, later, a swimming event.  “it was a four-by relay or whatever it’s called,” day said. “that’s how much i know about the olympics.”  as justin rose and henrik stenson were  showing off their    gold and silver medals  at bethpage black on tuesday, several of the other top golfers in the world were instead shaking off the rust from three weeks of competitive inertia — a respite that, in this frenzied golf season, must have felt like summer recess.        it allowed for some physical recovery for players like day, who was fighting a cold the last time he played, during the p.g.a. championship at baltusrol last month. and plenty of mental recovery. mcilroy, who missed the cut at the p.g.a. event, said the extensive break had allowed him to hit the reset button on a dismal season and work on issues, particularly his putting.            image     rory mcilroy opted for an isolated cabin in upstate new york, where there was no electricity, rather than a trip to rio.   credit  mike groll/associated press         “it was a nice time to do some work on that, but then have a little bit of a break and recharge,” mcilroy said.  whether the time off will give mcilroy and the others a competitive advantage at the barclays tournament, which begins thursday at the black course at bethpage state park, remains to be seen. many fans were critical of the decisions by top players like mcilroy, day and jordan spieth to decline invitations to compete for their countries in the first olympic golf tournament since 1904. the players cited various reasons for not playing, including security concerns and fears about the zika virus.  by not playing in rio, they could not win a medal. but they did get something else of considerable value: downtime. during the olympics, the pga tour continued with the travelers championship, the john deere classic and the wyndham championship, although those fields were not loaded with top players. four of the top five players in the world rankings took those weeks off, with stenson the exception.        in the fedex cup rankings, which determine who can compete for the $10 million cup prize, stenson, matt kuchar, bubba watson and patrick reed were the only players in the top 25 who competed in rio.  stenson, who  won the british open  last month, said he had known it was going to be a busy summer.  “i haven’t had more than one week off at any point since the end of may,” he said. “i guess we might not be fully charged, but we’re trying to conserve energy and not do too much out there.”  the p.g.a. of america has acknowledged the need to explore other options to avoid the drastic condensing of the year’s final two major tournaments that occurred in this unusual season. because the olympics began aug. 5, there was only a week separating the british open and the p.g.a. championship. olympic competition in men’s golf then began aug. 11, and now the fedex cup playoffs’ four tournaments will take place over the

weeks earlier in the season.  “i’m hoping that forced break early in the year will now begin to pay off for me,” rose said.  for some players who did skip the games, the decision did not come without some remorse. spieth, who  cited health concerns  in not attending rio, said that as he watched the tournament, he had felt pangs of regret for not suiting up for the united states.  “i wished i was there,” spieth said.  spieth has already announced his intention to compete for a spot in the 2020 olympics in tokyo. unlike some of the others, he said he had watched the rio golf tournament from start to finish and had found he was rooting for matt kuchar, who won bronze for the united states.        “at the time i made the decision, it was the right decision for me,” spieth said. “it was the hardest thing i’ve had to do. the potential for regret was going to be there. and it certainly was.”  mcilroy said he had managed to watch some of the final round and had come away impressed by the crowd and the intensity surrounding the match down the stretch. he had thought golf would be overlooked with so many other olympic events.  “it pleasantly surprised me,” mcilroy said. “to see the crowds and see the turnout, i was glad to be somewhat proven wrong.”  but was his decision to snub the games the right one? he will not know until sunday.  “it’s been a good three weeks,” mcilroy said. “i feel like i’m on the right path.”       ',\n",
       " 'rio de janeiro — the american men’s foil fencing team won a bronze medal on friday, the first medal for the united states in the event since 1932.  alexander massialas was the silver medalist in the individual event, and miles chamley-watson has a  flamboyant fencing move  named after him, but it was another member of the team, gerek meinhardt, who was the key. meinhardt broke open a tightly contested bronze medal match against italy with an 8-0 shellacking of andrea baldini, a former world champion, and put the united states in the lead to stay. the final score was 45-31.         a day of finals won and records broken     16 photos  view slide show  ›          image          quinn rooney/getty images.      “i didn’t fence great against egypt and russia,” meinhardt said, of the day’s earlier matches. “finally i broke through. frustration motivated me.”        race imboden rounded out the american team. a substitute, he fought just one bout, but won it, 5-4, and hollered at the audience in delight. the same four fencers had finished in the dreaded fourth position in london in 2012. imboden said the longtime camaraderie between the fencer was crucial to their success. “we’ve all known each other since we’ve been 10 years old.”  after the victory, chamley-watson gave imboden a piggy back ride as the delighted team celebrated.  it was a tough draw for the united states. italy was the top-ranked foil team coming into the competition, with the u.s. no. 2. italy was also the two-time defending olympic champion. its three-man team included the individual gold medalist, daniele garozzo.            image     alexander massialas, center, celebrated with his teammates race imboden and gerek meinhardt after the united states won the bronze medal in the men’s foil event on friday.   credit  laurence griffiths/getty images         after beating egypt in the quarterfinals, the americans had lost a hard-fought semifinal to russia, 45-41, earlier in the day despite a dynamic performance by chamley-watson. exulting after points, vigorously disputing calls, and seeming to feed off his success, the charismatic chamley-watson outscored his russian foes, 24-12, in his three bouts while his teammates were outscored, 33-17.  the team said they motivated themselves in the hours between the semifinal and bronze medal match by reading negative twitter posts about their performance. “haters are motivators,” chamley-watson said.        “we were so angry that we lost, but then one hour later we were laughing,” chamley-watson said. “the best athletes have the shortest memories.”       ',\n",
       " 'when you are the first american to win the new york city marathon in 40 years, you have two choices. you could go out on top. or you could try to defend your hard-fought title.  and that is what shalane flanagan, one of the best american female distance runners in a generation, decided to do in new york on sunday.  she had to settle for third.  flanagan surged from behind to lead one of the deepest fields of female american distance runners — four of the top seven finishers — in years. it included desiree linden (2018 boston champion), molly huddle (national 10-kilometer record-holder), allie kieffer (fifth in new york last year) and stephanie bruce (2018 10k national road champion).  flanagan, who added a bronze to her collection of gold and silver medals earned at new york, was sanguine.        “you just put your head down, keep working and fight for that podium spot,” she said. “so when i finally did get into that third place, i got another level of excitement and just felt really proud of myself in that moment that i kept fighting, even though there’s some rough patches in there.”  now flanagan’s career is again at a crossroads. she could attempt to make the team for her fifth olympics, in tokyo in 2020. or she could give in to the temptation to retire, and coach.  this race shows she’s still one of the best distance runners in the united states. although her chances of making the olympic marathon team are still strong, the field of contenders will be strong. (whoever makes the team may well earn an olympic medal, which no american marathoner has done since deena kastor took bronze in 2004.) flanagan has had a remarkably long athletic career. for those games, she would be 39.  at new york, flanagan suggested her professional racing career might be nearing the end of the road.            image     flanagan waved to the crowd at the starting line on staten island.   credit  joshua bright for the new york times         “i don’t want to be too soon to make a decision,” she said. “but i do feel like my heart is leaning toward serving others in the knowledge i’ve gained.”        she has established herself as a cultivator of some of the top distance-running talent in the nation.  her new york victory last year was the culmination of a career that inspired —  and, to some degree, drove  — a golden age of american female distance running. before that victory, she had spent years curating and nurturing a team of women at the bowerman track club in portland, ore., which she has named the bowerman babes.  each of her training partners — 11 in total — has qualified for the olympics while training with her. that’s an extraordinary success rate for any distance athlete or coach in this country.  as she gained stature, flanagan instigated a more collaborative approach among women in a sport that was historically secretive and fractious — and unsuccessful. in 2000, the united states sent just one woman to the olympic marathon.  now, the recent american women’s performance stands in contrast to the men’s. since 2014, no american man besides galen rupp has run a marathon under 2 hours 10 minutes — effectively equivalent to the sub-2:30 mark for women. this year in new york alone, four american women broke 2:30. no american men finished in the top five; the american women placed two there.  and the women’s marathon times keep dropping. flanagan herself has run the third-fastest american marathon ever. her victory at new york last year inspired linden, who then beat flanagan and huddle under bad conditions in last year’s boston marathon. but for flanagan that race was crushing.        “boston was so unsatisfying; i was ready, but with the conditions i just couldn’t showcase my fitness,” she said. “i just wanted to run a normal shalane race. i needed to have another.”  so she hit the streets of new york on sunday, ready to take the kind of athletic risks that only an incumbent can afford. she said she had no regrets.            image        “boston was so unsatisfying; i was ready but with the conditions i just couldn’t showcase my fitness,” flanagan said. “i just wanted to run a normal shalane race. i needed to have another of those.”   credit  hilary swift for the new york times         “it was a huge motivation to try to get in the top three today just because my standards for new york are pretty high,” she said. “i just thought, you know, if this truly is going to be my last race, a podium spot would be really special.”  eventually, she expects to transition into coaching her teammates in oregon, where she would become the nation’s first female coach at such a high level. she has fostered talent on her team, currently coached by jerry schumacher, whom flanagan initially joined as the only female runner at bowerman in 2009.  they’ve seen dramatic success. this summer, flanagan’s teammate courtney frerichs set the american record in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, and shelby houlihan, another teammate, set the american record in the 5,000 meters, with flanagan pacing her as a way to rebound after her boston disappointment.  “coming here to train with someone like shalane, who does everything right, it makes them believe in the possibilities,” schumacher said. “for them, it’s always been a case of, ‘who knows where training with someone like her can take me?’ i don’t have to coach that ambition; her presence makes it organic.”        flanagan has taken steps toward a next chapter in her life. she and her husband, steve, are seeking to adopt, and the two editions of the cookbook she has made for her running fans are best-sellers.  of course, flanagan could have retired even before her breakout marathon at new york last year and still been one of the best distance runners the united states has produced.  she is a four-time olympian, with a silver medal, who has won a world marathon major and is the third-fastest american marathon runner ever. she holds national records in the indoor 3,000 and 5,000 meters, as well as the road 10k and 15k. her marathon debut at new york in 2010 landed her second, the highest-placing performance for an american woman at the race in 20 years, a performance bettered only by her victory seven years later. and now she has this year’s bronze. at some point, it’s enough.  “i was joking around with jared earlier,” said flanagan, referring to schumacher, her coach. “he was like, shalane, you could be retired and just be hanging out. you don’t have to put yourself through this.”  then she reflected.  “but that’s what makes us feel really alive.”       ',\n",
       " 'the archetype of the olympian is evolving, as evidenced by the potential arrival of a new sort of athletic competitor at the summer games: b-boys and b-girls.  as part of an effort to appeal to younger fans, the organizing committee for the 2024 games in paris announced on thursday that it would recommend break dancing — yes, the street dance form with moves like flares, headspins and windmills — as a new sport to be added to its program.  the proposal — which also includes a recommendation that skateboarding, surfing and climbing, which will be introduced next year at the tokyo games, remain on the program — will be formally presented to the international olympic committee executive board at the end of march. the i.o.c. is not expected to confirm the events program for the 2024 games until december 2020.  break dancing was enthusiastically received when it made its  debut at the youth olympic games  last summer in buenos aires. the eventual medalists there hailed from russia, france, japan, south korea, canada, italy, austria, vietnam and argentina — a vivid sign perhaps of how extensively the activity has spread since its beginnings decades ago in new york city.        “breaking has two elements,” nakari shigeyuki, a japanese teenager known as shigekix who won a bronze medal at the youth event, told olympic.org in october. “one is sports, and one is arts. we need the stamina of athletes, but we also need to be artists, and express our feelings.”            image     besides break dancing, organizers hope to add surfing, skateboarding and climbing to the 2024 games.   credit  lionel bonaventure/agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         the sport’s potential moment in the global spotlight arrives as the i.o.c. continues its efforts to engage new fans — particularly young ones — in a sports landscape flowering with alternatives to the traditional olympic program.  to that end, the i.o.c. created new rules recently to allow host cities to recommend new sports for the olympics program. organizers for the 2020 games in toyko proposed baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, which the i.o.c. eventually approved. (because host city recommendations are valid for one olympic games only, karate and baseball/softball will not return in paris.)  paris 2024 organizers said their aim was to include “sports that can be shared on social media, sports that are a means of getting around, forms of expression, lifestyles in their own right, sports that are practiced every day, in the street and elsewhere.”        the organizers said their values led them to “sustainable and socially responsible” sports that do not require permanent facilities; sports that will engage young people and those in urban communities; and sports that are culturally relevant to france.  another initiative in that vein will be the opportunity for amateurs to run the olympic marathon course after the official race has ended (which is, in essence, how most major marathons in the world operate, with a group of professional competitors preceding a larger, amateur field).  in their break dancing proposal, paris 2024 organizers said there would be men’s and women’s events with a total of 32 athletes who would officially be referred to as b-boys and b-girls.  the competitions, meanwhile, would be referred to as “battles” and feature dancers taking turns performing dance moves and spins on the floor. each routine would be graded, the organizers said, on criteria “such as technique, variety, performance, musicality, creativity and personality.”       ',\n",
       " 'rio de janeiro — katie ledecky’s pushed herself so hard on the first 150 meters of the 200 freestyle on tuesday night that she swam the final length of the pool on the brink of exhaustion, with bile rising in her throat, she said. somehow, she got to the wall first.  ledecky finished in 1 minute 53.73 seconds to edge sweden’s sarah sjostrom, who clocked a 1:54.08. emma mckeon of australia was third in 1:54.92, 26-hundredths of a second faster than italy’s federica pellegrini, who holds the world record of 1:52.98 in 2009.            image      credit  doug mills/the new york times         “that was such a tough race,” ledecky said. “i came pretty close to throwing up the last 50. everything was hurting.” she added, “i just had to dig deep. i had no idea whether i had touched first.”        when ledecky saw the “1” next to her name on the scoreboard, she was filled with relief, she said. there was more riding on the outcome than a gold medal.            image         credit  doug mills/the new york times               with the victory, she kept alive her bid to become the first swimmer since debbie meyer in 1968 to win the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles in the same olympics. ledecky set a world record in the 400 freestyle on saturday en route to victory and is the overwhelming favorite to successfully defend her title in the 800 on friday. she is the third woman, after meyer and shane gould of australia, to win gold in both the 200 and 400 freestyle at the same olympics.        “it’s pretty cool,” ledecky said. “usually i don’t really think about the history like that. i think i’m just really honored to be part of the tradition of american freestyle swimming.”            image         credit  doug mills/the new york times         at a meet in mesa, ariz., in april, meyer saw ledecky and told her it was her time to win all three events. “she told me she wanted me to do it,” ledecky said. “i don’t want to let her down.”  the eight finalists came out for their pre-race introductions to a highly-charged atmosphere. the partisan crowd was abuzz over the brazilian marcelo chierighin’s advancement to the 100-meter final in the previous race. with no brazilian in the women’s 200 freestyle final, the crowd adopted ledecky, giving her the loudest reception. she needed all the support she could get.  the 200, which ledecky began swimming at the international level last summer, figured to offer the most resistance in her attempt to match meyer’s feat. it was a tricky race to strategize because it represented the point of intersection for the distance-oriented ledecky, 19, and the sprinter sjostrom, 22, who won the gold medal in the 100-meter butterfly and is entered in the 50-meter freestyle later in the week.  “the 200 free is such a more stressful event for me than the 400 or the 800 just because i can’t really settle into my rhythm,” she said. “one mistake and you’re done.”              ledecky misjudged her second turn, and didn’t get a solid push off the wall. she thought that might be the miscue that would end up costing her. sjostrom, who was almost half-a-second behind ledecky at the 100, did make up a little ground on the third 50, but ledecky nailed her third turn and stormed home, ignoring her body’s objections.  “i just had to get my hand on the wall and be done,” ledecky said.

       " 'in many ways, there has never been a better time to be a member of the united states women’s national hockey team.  two years after the players  threatened to boycott  the world championship tournament over pay equity, u.s.a. hockey, the national governing body, is paying them more than ever, about $71,000 each annually.  on the ice, the american women have continued to exceed the achievements of the men’s national team and won their second olympic gold medal in  a stirring final against canada .  members of the team have skated in the skills competition at n.h.l. all-star weekend and served as analysts for n.h.l. television broadcasts. participation in the sport among girls and women is  skyrocketing .        but halfway through the labor contract with u.s.a. hockey signed in march 2017, as the national team begins its pursuit of a fifth straight world championship in finland this week, its players wonder whether the future of their sport is as bright as the present. those concerns grew after the canadian women’s hockey league, one of two professional leagues in north america, announced sunday  it would fold in may .  although the american players negotiated gains in salary and travel and medical benefits two years ago, the “ groundbreaking support ” for girls and women’s hockey promised by u.s.a. hockey in the contract has been slow to develop. the women’s high performance advisory group created in the deal has been largely invisible. minimal promotion for the team and a lack of organizational diversity in u.s.a. hockey also raise concerns from players and female alumni that little has changed.  “people are drooling for women’s hockey,” forward kendall coyne schofield said in an interview late last year. “but the product we deliver isn’t being shown. there’s been a lot of lost opportunities, a lot of opportunities that haven’t been capitalized on.”            image     kendall coyne schofield, left, and hilary knight have complained about the lack of exposure the team had when its popularity was the highest after the olympics.   credit  jung yeon-je/agence france-presse — getty images         those opportunities included high-profile media appearances before the olympics like a national magazine feature, a major network documentary series and other live television offers, which u.s.a. hockey declined, according to three people with direct knowledge of those projects. after the olympics, some players were unaware that they were eligible for four-figure bonuses offered by hershey’s for winning the gold medal.        u.s.a. hockey’s executive director, pat kelleher, was not made available for an interview to discuss the women’s national team.  after the olympics, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, but players were frustrated that there were no plans for a post-olympic exhibition tour. in an interview late last year, forward hilary knight lamented that the team disappeared when its popularity was at its highest.  because of the talent disparity between north american teams and the rest of the world, there are  not many viable opponents for the americans , and canada’s cooperation is necessary. last month, the two nations finally staged a three-game exhibition series, with one game in the united states. an announced crowd of 9,048 fans attended the game in detroit, which was also broadcast live on nhl network.  but other avenues to increase exposure do not need canadian co-signs, like merchandising. nike, the official apparel supplier of u.s.a. hockey and a company that champions equality in advertisements, does not sell jerseys of american women’s players or products specifically featuring female players. neither does u.s.a. hockey’s online store.  coyne schofield, one of the players who has been featured by the n.h.l. since the olympics, is inundated with inquiries from parents about where they can buy apparel with her name. she has memorized a response with detailed instructions on how to purchase customized men’s items, even down to the six-week shipping time frame. that’s how knight obtained replicas of her jersey for her family.  “that alone is so degrading,” coyne schofield said. “there’s no reason why anybody shouldn’t be able to go on  usahockey.com  and buy a hilary knight jersey, my jersey. right now, women’s hockey is not accessible to consumers. it needs to be accessible in every fashion.”        nike, which  recently unveiled soccer kits  for the 2019 women’s world cup that for the first time were specifically designed for women’s teams, did not respond to requests to discuss its women’s hockey apparel.            image        kendall coyne schofield competed in the fastest skater competition during n.h.l. all-star weekend in january.   credit  ben margot/associated press         as with the jerseys, the american players handle much of their promotion themselves. despite repeated requests from athletes, u.s.a. hockey has not created social medial channels dedicated solely to the women’s team, as u.s. soccer has. olympians like coyne schofield and monique lamoureux-morando worked as analysts on nhl network and nbcsn. the players have lobbied the n.h.l. for more support for women’s hockey, particularly for its professionals, whose salaries range from $2,000 to $10,000.  the women’s high performance advisory group was supposed to be a conduit of influence for the players. over the past two years, u.s.a. hockey declined repeated requests to discuss the group.  the new york times confirmed the participation of at least five women in the group, including hockey executives and members of the 2018 olympic team. multiple people with knowledge of meetings said the group was stagnant in its first year and only recently began having meaningful conversations. one player said she was unsure if she was allowed to talk about the group.  in march, the n.h.l. and the n.h.l. players’ association  announced the formation of their own female hockey advisory committee  with the goal “to accelerate the growth” of hockey for girls and women in north america, and named 11 members, all women. they include michele amidon, a former director for women’s hockey at u.s.a. hockey, and several former members of the u.s. national women’s team.  but women’s representation remains lacking in u.s.a. hockey’s leadership.  of all american winter olympic governing sports bodies, u.s.a. hockey has the lowest percentage of women on its board of directors (17.58 percent) and is the worst at reaching its benchmark for female hires, according to the most recent data available from the united states olympic committee.  there are full-fledged councils within u.s.a. hockey devoted to youth, adult and junior hockey, but none specifically for girls and women. decisions related to girls’ and women’s hockey are administered by the youth council, which is led by a man and where only four of the 25 members are women. there are also no women on the organization’s marketing council.        proponents for u.s. women’s hockey have long struggled to have their voices heard. lynn olson became the first woman hired to work for u.s.a. hockey’s girls and women’s section back in 1988, but it served only as an advisory panel to the board of directors.  during her tenure, which ended in 2013, olson described u.s.a. hockey as being run like a “good old boys club.” she was sometimes denied funds to hold meetings for her panel, so she put up her own money. olson also said she tried to make the section a full-fledged council, which would provide more influence, writing up legislation that never passed.            image        the united states and canada played an exhibition game in detroit in february that drew more than 9,000 fans and was broadcast live on nhl network.   credit  gregory shamus/getty images         olson noted that more women wanted to be involved in u.s.a. hockey, but had a hard time getting elected to positions of power. “you need to change the minds of males in the room,” she said.  veteran leaders of the hockey team expressed faith that the culture could change under kelleher, who was named u.s.a. hockey’s executive director in april 2017. in recent months, he met with players in maine, chicago and michigan.  “we hadn’t had that in the past,” coyne schofield said. “for me, it was a huge first impression.”  the united states national women’s soccer team, an  inspiration for the hockey team  in its fight for equality, was so frustrated with the lack of progress on a number of issues that the players recently  filed a gender discrimination lawsuit  against its governing body, u.s. soccer.  knight said she did not yet foresee a repeat of the fraught 2017 negotiations that led to the boycott threat and a fracture between u.s.a. hockey and the women’s team that is still being repaired.        u.s.a. hockey seems to be aware of the need for more gender balance. don gould, chairman of the girls and women’s section, said at the federation’s annual meeting that the organizational culture must evolve to advance opportunities for girls and women, socially and in sport.  “this objective cannot be realized without first creating an environment that values them equally at every level,” gould said. “whether we work on the bench or in the boardroom, this is our first obligation.”  but nine of 10 members of u.s.a. hockey’s committee that nominates candidates to become officers of the organization are men.

       " 'nbc’s summer games broadcasts should be thought of as an olympic edition of “america’s got talent,” a 17-day series about a rousingly successful american team tailored to an american audience that is probably happy to watch americans do fantastically well in rio de janeiro.  america’s talent has produced more than 80 medals so far, well more than its closest rivals, china and britain. it is easy, then, for nbc, the primary conduit to the games for most americans, to justify its extreme focus on american exceptionalism, especially when gymnasts and swimmers of the united states team have done so well in sports that are critical to the network’s prime-time success.  there are few pretenses to nbc’s pro-american predisposition in brazil. and while it is not found in unabashed, biased admiration — there has been some, most notably on women’s eight rowing — it has been visible in who is interviewed after an event or whose families are glimpsed in stadiums and arenas.         bolt is back     13 photos  view slide show  ›          image          doug mills/the new york times      consider when michael phelps finally lost a race, the 100-meter butterfly, to little-known  joseph schooling  of singapore, the post-race interview was with phelps. the fascination with phelps is undeniable. but schooling’s victory, singapore’s first-ever olympic gold medal, was newsworthy for being a surprise, and he could have elaborated on the photo that nbc showed of him as a child, with phelps, during michele tafoya’s interview with phelps. if schooling was not as available immediately after his win, nbc could have taped an interview with him  (as carrie brown of bein sports did afterward   in an area where the news media interview athletes) to use in subsequent swimming coverage.        schooling sounded disarmingly honest, and not programmed by being overinterviewed. “i wouldn’t say i denied him a fifth gold medal,” he told brown. “he has, like 22 or 23. he doesn’t need one more. he has enough.”  another moment in swimming called out for a fairer approach. simone manuel and penny oleksiak of canada tied for the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle. the race itself was called with reasonable objectivity by dan hicks and rowdy gaines; the importance of manuel being the first african-american woman to win an individual olympic swimming event was played up (“i am one happy camper!” gaines shouted, losing the aforementioned objectivity). but in the follow-up interview with manuel, tafoya questioned her as if she were the sole winner.            image     simone manuel of the united states and penny oleksiak of canada tied for the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle. manuel was the first african-american woman to win an individual olympic swimming event. in a follow-up interview with manuel, michele tafoya questioned her as if she were the sole winner, and oleksiak was not interviewed.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         and oleksiak was not interviewed, a fact not lost on  some canadians .  when shaunae miller of the bahamas defeated the popular american, allyson felix, with a  dramatic dive  across the finish line in the 400 meters on monday night, the post-race interview was with felix, not miller. each had a story to tell but viewers only heard felix’s. yet, to have learned more about miller’s dive would have been more illuminating than felix, who was gracious and disappointed, but did not say much.        “felix was the defending gold medalist and a major story for american olympic fans,” said greg hughes, a spokesman for nbc sports, “and the american audience wants to hear from u.s. athletes.” he said adding a schooling interview later would have required time to retell his story, time that could be devoted to live swimming.  the pro-american approach is one nbc rarely detours from. it is in the dna of olympic broadcasting. networks around the world with the rights to the games can toll their jingo bells when they please. and it’s easier to interview your own nation’s athletes, especially if language barriers exist.         a u.s. first, and the usual for jamaica     17 photos  view slide show  ›          image             doug mills/the new york times      still, there should be a better way to present these stories without so much american navel-gazing — perhaps expending extra effort to talk after an event to many more medal-winning foreign athletes besides usain bolt, who, as a shrewd olympic personality, recognizes the value of making himself available to nbc.  one example that showed the good sense in talking to foreign athletes was an interview with the winner of the men’s pole vault, thiago braz da silva of brazil, whose delight in the gold medal was matched by his marked disbelief. (not even nbc could resist a hometown hero in brazil.)  but there have not been enough like him, depriving us of at least a little window into the outside world.            image        thiago braz da silva of brazil celebrated after winning the gold medal in the pole vault with bronze medalist sam kendricks of the united states. in an interview, his delight in the gold medal was matched by his marked disbelief.   credit  shaun botterill/getty images         nbc says it has also interviewed the swimmers sarah sjostrom of sweden and pernille blume of denmark in prime time and others on different channels and that it has shown features of at least a dozen foreign athletes,  including larissa, the brazilian beach volleyball star .  during tuesday night’s men’s 110-meter hurdles, devon allen was nbc’s temporary fascination. you saw his parents. you heard he was a receiver for the university of oregon and that the football team had gathered in eugene to watch him. you saw him in preliminary races before the final. you saw his parents again before the final. and you saw allen finish fifth to omar mcleod of jamaica. but mcleod — who attended the university of arkansas — got far less love for winning.  a more glaring example was nbc’s overhyping of sydney mclaughlin as the “17-year-old sensation from new jersey” before the 400-meter hurdles semifinals. the segment opened with a short feature about her. then we saw her parents (but no one else’s). yet as she faded to fifth and as nbc replayed the race, the coverage, with comments by ato boldon and sanya richards-ross, became about her struggles, her superstar talent and her expected return to the summer games in 2020.  after the loss, nbc talked only to mclaughlin, even as the winner, zuzana hejnova of the czech republic, walked behind mclaughlin as she was speaking to nbc’s lewis johnson.  friends and family like the mclaughlins attend the olympics, usually at great expense, to root on their sons, daughters, cousins, spouses, fiancées and friends. nbc usually shows us americans cheering for americans, like manuel; sprinter english gardner; phelps (his mother, fiancée and baby, boomer, are as familiar as the dunphys of “modern family”); gymnasts simone biles, laurie hernandez and aly raisman; divers abby johnston and kristian ipsen, and hurdler dalilah muhammad. nbc always knows where to find them.  the shock when nbc finds the families of foreign athletes, like the australian swimmers cate and bronte campbell, and mo farah of britain, who  won gold  in the 10,000 meters, is worthy of a gasp of joy.

       " 'who knew that the hero of the rio games would be a gray-haired, mustachioed russian in his late 50s, who used his scientific brilliance not to search for a disease’s cure but to help russians win olympic medals by dissolving banned performance-enhancing drugs into chivas and vermouth?  a hero who, under the cloak of night, switched drug-tainted urine for clean urine so that athletes who had doped wouldn’t test positive.  if that doesn’t sound like a character you could cheer for, well, then, you’re missing the big picture in this chapter of the long-running story of doping in sports. because if this saga is ever going to have a semblance of a happy ending, it needs more heroes like this one. flawed heroes, yes, but ones whose eventual contribution to clean sport is immeasurable.            wada investigation of sochi allegations  the report by richard mclaren, a canadian lawyer commissioned by wada, confirmed “beyond a reasonable doubt” that russia was involved in an elaborate doping scheme that stretched beyond the sochi games.       this rio hero is dr. grigory rodchenkov, the former director of russia’s antidoping lab, who helped athletes dope and cover up their drug use because his government asked him to. what makes him a hero in today’s olympic movement — one of the current heroes, i should say — is that he was brave enough to blow the whistle on russia’s state-sponsored doping program. he  spilled the details to the new york times  in may, prompting the world anti-doping agency to investigate his claims and, two months later, to validate them in a report made public on monday.        because rodchenkov told his story, there just might be fewer dopers competing in the rio games next month. his efforts could also embolden other whistle-blowers to come forward and expose cheating in sports. this could be a watershed moment for olympic sport in its longstanding battle with dopers.  but that will happen only if the international olympic committee backs up the efforts of these whistle-blowers and punishes russia appropriately, now that the world knows the russian government was in on the whole doping program. even top russian government officials were involved in the scheme to dominate olympic sports, with the deputy minister for sport personally deciding which failed doping tests to cover up.  thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee, and the i.o.c.’s executive board met on tuesday to begin discussing russia’s fate, announcing afterward that the committee was considering its legal options for discipline and had established a five-person disciplinary commission to assess the facts of the case.         video                    richard mclaren, a canadian lawyer who led the world anti-doping agency&#x27;s investigation into russian olympic cheating, said russia&#x27;s security service was involved in the scheme.   credit   credit  peter power/reuters        but here was the gist of the meeting: after more reams of dark details of russian state-sponsored doping were revealed in monday’s 97-page wada report, bach and the i.o.c. will decide whether any russians should compete in rio.  bach talked tough before the meeting.  “the findings of the report show a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the olympic games,” bach said in a statement monday. “therefore, the i.o.c. will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organization implicated.”  the russian track and field federation was barred from the games in the wake of revelations of state-sponsored doping of its competitors, which were made public in a wada report last november, the first of two wada reports about widespread cheating in russia.  the basis of that investigation? information from whistle-blowers.  the heroes in that case were vitaly stepanov, who used to work at the russian antidoping agency, and his wife, yuliya stepanova, a runner who had doped under the russian system. they secretly recorded russian coaches and athletes talking about their doping, then they gave the information and told their stories to ard, a german broadcaster that aired a blockbuster documentary on russian doping in 2014.            russian doctor explains how he helped beat doping tests at the sochi olympics  a step-by-step look at how russian agents used an elaborate scheme to swap out tainted urine samples for clean ones taken months earlier.       with their young son, the stepanovs fled russia and are now living in the united states, fearing for their lives, with good reason. in doing the right thing by exposing russia’s doping program, they took on a country where winning at all costs was the mantra. rodchenkov took the same risks for speaking out against russia’s doping machine.  knowing all that, the i.o.c. should slap russia with  a swift and stinging ban  — on tuesday, the organization said it  was weighing that possibility  — but it takes guts to do so. it takes someone who will champion these whistle-blowers so the efforts of those who spoke out mean something. so more athletes feel comfortable coming forward to talk about the underbelly of sports.        the antidoping agencies of at least 10 nations, including the united states, germany and canada, have asked for the i.o.c. to bar the entire russian delegation from rio. some clean athletes have voiced their opinions, too.  “as an athlete going to rio, i would not like to be competing against russian swimmers because i wouldn’t have faith that they hadn’t been doping,” kirsty coventry, a two-time olympic gold medalist for zimbabwe and a member of the i.o.c. athletes’ commission, told me in a telephone conversation.  bach and the i.o.c. could kick out the russian delegation. that would be the simplest way to make a point. or they could do what the i.o.c. does best, and that’s let international sports federations do the dirty work. the federations could be charged with picking through the mass of russian cheaters to choose clean athletes, case by case, to compete in rio. with more than 25 federations, that process could drag on forever.  whatever bach does, he at least should acknowledge the value of the whistle-blowers in all of this mess, and thank them for their work. without them, russian athletes who have doped would very likely have won medals in rio — perhaps only to have those medals snatched back years later, when the drug testers finally caught up with them. (that does not mean doped-up athletes from other countries won’t become champions in rio.)  it would be a nice touch, too, if bach acknowledged the yawning holes in the antidoping system, gaps that allowed the russians to be so bold in their cheating, and pushed forward with a plan for a truly independent antidoping organization that would do all the testing and the follow-up. we know now that individual nations involved in the testing of their own athletes are so easily corrupted.  rodchenkov’s late-night switching of urine samples at the 2014 sochi games was just a snapshot of russia’s duplicity. the whole well-organized scheme makes lance armstrong’s doping, once labeled by the united states anti-doping agency as “the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,” look as if it were run by teenagers in a high school chemistry class.        the i.o.c. is facing perhaps the biggest doping scandal in sports history. the whistle-blowers are holding their breath. the russians and clean athletes are, too.  all while bach is sitting at his laptop, crafting the ending to this hero’s play.  the rio games are less than three weeks away. he’d better type fast.

       " \"during the 2017 united states open,  serena williams , holder of 23 grand slam titles, was fighting for her life. she had just given birth to alexis olympia ohanian jr. by cesarean section and faced life-threatening  complications  from a pulmonary embolism and blood clotting.  she would be bedridden for six weeks.   one year later, she is back on the u.s. open courts, attempting to tie margaret court’s record of 24 grand slam titles.   her return, which has included a run to the wimbledon final in july, should be surprising to exactly no one. williams has joined a league of simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary women, those who return to work after childbirth and quickly perform at a very high level. elite athletes just have a different kind of office environment awaiting them.   in 1960, two years after giving birth to her daughter, the sprinter  wilma rudolph  won three gold medals at the rome olympics.  sheryl swoopes  returned to the basketball court six

giving birth to her second daughter. the british heptathlete jessica ennis-hill gave birth to her first son in july 2014. she won gold at the world championships 13 months later.        because of a lack of scientific data, there are few studies on elite athletes who give birth and return to the highest levels of competition soon thereafter, said dr. miho tanaka\\u200b, director of the women’s sports medicine program at johns hopkins.             image     wilma rudolph, on her way to three gold medals at the 1960 olympics, as the mother of a toddler.   credit  associated press

toward individualized recommendations and their innate ability to be hyper-aware of their own bodies. whatever attributes allow elite athletes to get to their level of fitness and bounce back from injury with greater speed can surely help them return to sport after childbirth, tanaka said. “but what that mechanism is — whether that’s physical or mental, or both — that formula would be hard to translate.”   dr. cordelia carter, director of the women’s sports medicine center at n.y.u. langone health, said williams had an uncomplicated pregnancy but a very complicated postpartum period, and she continues to achieve above and beyond what many, rightly or wrongly, thought was possible. “so looking at her, we don’t yet know our limits, which is powerful,” she said.        it always has

       " 'hundreds of athletes at the rio games showed the many ways to celebrate winning an olympic medal. this was claressa shields’s on sunday: she dropped to one knee after her middleweight boxing bout and quickly sprang to her feet. then she kept moving — cartwheeling, laughing, running laps around the ring, the american flag billowing like a parasail over her head. she swayed to some internal music as she waited to step onto the podium.  on the final day of the summer games, shields won one of the last gold medals for the united states and became the first american boxer since 1904 to win two olympic golds.  “you know not everybody can be an olympic gold medalist,” she said. “i’m a two-time olympic gold medalist. oh my god, i can’t believe i just said that.”  shields, who won gold in london four years ago, nearly shut out her opponent sunday in the gold-medal bout, nouchka fontijn of the netherlands. all three judges scored the first three rounds 10-9 in shields’s favor. one judge gave her the fourth as well, while the other two went 10-9 for fontijn.        in the first round, fontijn looked like a boxer with a plan. she was relaxed and confident, using her height advantage and long arms to counter and to keep shields at a distance. shields exploded forward several times, heaving big right hands. shields glided in behind her triple jab. it wasn’t until seconds before the bell, however, that any of them landed flush.  “i told her that was very close,” said the american coach billy walsh. “i’m not sure whether we got this round or not. we gotta close her down a bit more, start working a bit more, use your jab a bit more. put that right hand over the top.”  shields got the message and started driving home her punches in in round two. she also began slipping fontijn’s shots. fontijn circled and jabbed, but shields, determined, kept stalking her to the end of round three.  up by three rounds, shields came out to play in the fourth. she crouched low and shimmied backward, luring fontijn with her hands down. she danced and goaded, ducking nearly every shot fontijn threw. she landed two hard right hands, and waved fontijn in.  “i hit you with a hard shot, hit me back,” she said later, recalling the moment. “i want to see if you can hit me.”        shields landed one more left hook as the final bell rung.  shields accepted her rio games medal and then pulled out the gold medal she won in london, and hung it around her neck alongside the new one.  the final medals standings              marathon gold for kipchoge  the favorite eliud kipchoge of kenya won the olympic marathon on sunday, drawing away over the final four miles to win in 2 hours 8 minutes 44 seconds. feyisa lilesa of ethiopia took second in 2:09:54, while galen rupp of the united states won the bronze medal in 2:10:05, his personal best. kenya swept both marathons at the rio games. jemima sumgong won the women’s 26.2-mile race, becoming the first kenyan woman to win a

has been subjected to indelicate and unrelenting public scrutiny for years, won her first olympic gold medal on saturday at the rio games.  semenya won the 800 meters by a comfortable margin, in 1 minute 55.28 seconds. while her performances tend to carry the weight of an issue that transcends sports, those looking for undeniable athletics excellence saturday night were rewarded: her runaway victory solidified her standing as one of the best middle-distance runners of her generation.        francine niyonsaba of burundi was second in 1:56.49, and margaret wambui of kenya was third in 1:56.89.  when semenya, then 18, dominated the 800 at the 2009 world track and field championships, winning by more than two seconds, a fellow competitor called her a man, setting off a years-long debate over how sports officials should navigate the complicated question of how to determine an athlete’s sex.  the questioning of semenya’s success led to a policy enacted in 2011 by the i.a.a.f., the sport’s governing body, that restricted the permitted levels of testosterone, which occur naturally high in some women. that condition is called hyperandrogenism.  with that policy in effect, semenya won silver at the 2012 london games.  last year, the court of arbitration for sport, the swiss-based high court for international sport,  suspended track and field’s testosterone policy  for two years.  the court said it had been “unable to conclude that hyperandrogenic female athletes may benefit from such a significant performance advantage that it is necessary to exclude them from competing in the female category.”  • mo farah of britain  added the    5,000-meter    gold  to the one he earned in the 10,000. in the  1,500 , american  matthew centrowitz upset asbel kiprop  of

       " 'mary keitany was back where she prefers to be sunday in the new york city marathon — far, far ahead of everyone else. keitany, an olympian from kenya, took off alone in the race’s second half and finished more than three minutes ahead of her challengers, with a time of 2 hours 22 minutes 48 seconds. it was her fourth victory here, and the second fastest race any woman has run on this course.  it started out typically enough. for the first half of the race, keitany, 36, tucked into a pack of about 24 women, including some of the top talent in this event. keeping her stride loose, keitany looked like just another jogger — albeit, a pretty fast one — as she made her way through the early stages.  once she reached manhattan, though, there was a race to run.  soon out of view of her closest opponent, keitany tore through the second half of the marathon in 1:06:58, a time few women in the field had achieved. it was about nine minutes faster than her first half, and she never wavered as she ground toward the finish.        but by now, keitany is used to running like this. after all, she has the second-fastest time of any woman in the marathon, behind only paula radcliffe.            image     keitany won the new york city marathon for the fourth time.   credit  michelle v. agins/the new york times         “nothing was special today,” she said afterward. “i was just ready for the race.”   [   lelisa desisa won the men’s race    in today’s new york city marathon.]   her expression was casual, as though she could have headed back to staten island and do it all over again.  manuela schär of switzerland won the title in the women’s wheelchair division for the second straight year, with a time of 1:50:27.  when keitany is at the top of her game, she is notoriously difficult to touch. she is known for taking off early in the race and challenging her rivals to follow — which she did in 2014, 2015, and  again in 2016 . and then sunday, as her pace dipped below five minutes per mile, none of those rivals had an answer.            image        manuela schär won the women’s wheelchair division for the second consecutive year.   credit  uli seit for the new york times         they included another woman from kenya, vivian cheruiyot, 35, who took second place in 2:26:02.  and then there was a chasing pack of american women, who collectively finished the best they had since 1978.  the americans were led by the defending champion shalane flanagan, 37, who took third in 2:26:22.  even though flanagan did not retain her title, her satisfaction was just as high, and her time — with the ideal conditions of 46 degrees, calm and sunny — was better. last year, as she closed in on the victory tape at new york, breaking keitany’s winning streak, flanagan was yelling expletives in a euphoria.  this year, her finish was similarly emotional. but this time, she yelled to the crowds cheering her on, “i love you.”  “i was just overcome with emotion, in that stretch, as everyone is,” flanagan said. “it was like, yeah, i love this community, i love the running community and i love new yorkers. i’ve had an unbelievable time performing here.”            image        mary keitany won the women’s race.   credit  uli seit for the new york times         it may be flanagan’s final professional race. she used her looming retirement as motivation to showcase the speed that helped her outkick keitany last year and that has earned her a silver medal in the 10,000 meters in the 2008 olympics.        as any hope of catching keitany and repeating her victory from last year dissipated sunday, flanagan closed in on rahma tusa of ethiopia, who was fading in the final miles, and sprinted away to secure a podium finish.  “as i was racing and kind of feeling sorry for myself, you have to find motivation, things to rally and to focus on,” flanagan said. “when i got dropped by mary and a bunch of other women, i kept thinking, ‘keep fighting.’ you never know what’s going to happen in front of you, and just put your head down, keep working and fight for that podium spot.”  flanagan’s performance rounded out a collection of medals from her appearances in the new york marathon, adding a bronze to last year’s gold and a silver in 2010.  it was a breakout day for american distance runners overall. four of them finished in the top seven; in comparison, the top american to finish in the men’s race was jared ward, in sixth place. the american record-holder in the half marathon, molly huddle, finished behind flanagan in fourth. the defending boston marathon champion, desiree linden, finished sixth. and allie kieffer, who as a self-coached unknown last year finished fifth place, took seventh today behind linden.  “americans right now are a great group of runners,” linden said.  she added: “we’re continually pushing the bar for each other. now you can win a major one year and not even be the top american at the next race, which is insane.”       ',\n",
       " 'gerina piller’s tear ducts sprang a leak on the 18th green when she tapped in for a par after missing her fourth birdie attempt in four holes. she cried as she left the green and cried as she left the scoring area.  on her way to the locker room, piller cried as she signed autographs for the south korean fans, who were exultant over their countrywoman inbee park’s gold medal victory and quickly converged on her.  smiling through tears, piller signed everything thrust in front of her and posed with every fan who jumped in her path for a photograph. at one point, the brazilian player victoria lovelady waded into the tide of people and embraced piller, whose shoulders shook as she sobbed in her arms.  this is the power and the pathos of the olympics. it can take an athlete like piller, who did not expect to qualify for the olympics two months ago, and turn her into an emotional wreck because she fell short of the medal podium.        piller, 31, was not on the united states team until she tied for eighth at the united states women’s open in july and squeezed into the top 15 in the world rankings. after three solid rounds, she began saturday’s final 18 holes two strokes behind the leader, park, who closed with a five-under-par 66 for a 72-hole total of 16 under at reserva de marapendi. piller posted a 74 to finish 10 strokes back, tied for 11th in the field of 60.         rounding the bend in rio     12 photos  view slide show  ›          image          james hill for the new york times      park, 28, was playing against top competition for the first time since she was sidelined with a wrist injury in mid-june. a seven-time major winner, park bypassed the united states women’s open and the women’s british open, two big-paycheck events, to try to be in the best possible shape for the return of women’s golf at the olympics after a 116-year absence.  “after i made the decision to play this week, somewhere in my heart, i really believed in myself that i can do it,” park said, adding, “i’ve had trust in my heart, and just put some really hard work into it, and sometimes hard work pays off.”  the silver medal went to new zealand’s lydia ko, who birdied the par-5 18th hole for a 69 to finish at 11 under, one stroke better than china’s shanshan feng (69). all the medalists are major champions who shouldered huge medal expectations in their homelands.        piller is a late bloomer who did not take up golf until she was 15, the same age as ko was when she won her first l.p.g.a. title in 2012. with eight top-10 finishes, piller has been circling her first l.p.g.a. victory all year. fueled by patriotism, piller envisioned rocketing onto the sporting world’s radar with a breakthrough performance.  “i think gerina still had a fantastic week, and i think she made the whole of the u.s. proud,” ko said, adding: “sometimes i think we can get carried away by just the results, but i said the olympics is about celebrating each and every player, celebrating obviously the medalists at the end of the tournament. but i think gerina, when she looks back, she’ll say, ‘wow, that was a great week.’”  maria verchenova, the first russian to play on the ladies european tour, had a great final round, closing with a course-record 62 that included her first hole-in-one in competition. she finished tied for 16th at four under, which she said was more than she had dared hope for before the rio games started. two weeks before the opening ceremony, verchenova said she had not been sure that she would be allowed to participate because of a doping scandal that threatened to result in all russian athletes’ being barred from the games.            decisive moments at the rio olympics, frame by frame  see the summer games in a series of composite images.       verchenova expressed gratitude for being able to participate. “it’s funny, because if you look from the outside, it’s very simple,” she said. “like the athletes’ village is very simple, the rooms are very simple. it’s the atmosphere that makes it amazing.”  on the olympic stage, every result, for better or worse, is magnified. after piller broke free from the pack of autograph seekers, her mother and stepfather caught up and were walking on either side of her. piller slipped her hand into her stepfather’s, and her mother put her arm protectively around piller’s back as the three continued walking in silence. “we’re heartbroken with her,” piller’s stepfather, alan stevenson, said.  what will he tell piller? “you keep working, you keep playing, you keep competing, you keep showing up,” he said.        piller emerged from the locker room. wiping tears from her face, she said: “i think i’ll cherish this week forever. just taking a lot of positives away from it.”  she added: “i didn’t even think i had a chance to be here, so to come and to be in contention is all i can really ask for. just going to learn from it and move on.”  piller said she was looking forward to walking in sunday’s closing ceremony. finding herself marching alongside the best athletes in the world would have been unthinkable at the start of the year. but on saturday afternoon, that was small consolation to piller, whose post-round interview ended in tears.

       " 'rio de janeiro — the katie ledecky-led u.s. team struck gold in the women’s 4x200 freestyle relay. so what else is new? since the event became a part of the olympic program in 1996, the americans have won five of the six golds.  ledecky anchored a squad that included allison schmitt, leah smith and maya dirado to a 1.84-second victory over australia, the only other country to triumph in the event at the summer games. canada was third. the americans were trailing by 89-hundredths of a second when ledecky hit the water. she split 1 minute 53.74 seconds, to stop the clock at 7:43.03.            image     maya dirado   credit  jeffrey furticella/the new york times         “that was so much fun,” said ledecky, whose teammates embraced her after she finished. “we just had so much fun with it. we were smiling the whole time – before, during and after.”            image         credit  jeffrey furticella/the new york times         the americans trailed australia after three legs, but ledecky chased down tamsin cook, spurred by a spectacular first turn that gave her the lead.            image        katie ledecky   credit  jeffrey furticella/the new york times         ledecky’s split of 1:53.74 was nine-tenths of a second faster than anyone else’s.              the americans’ performance may have been a victory for the status quo, but the u.s. relay served as a reminder of how the only constant from one olympics to the next is change.        counting her relay swim, ledecky has raced eight times in the first five days and covered 1,800 meters. at the london games four years ago, she did not race for the first time until day 6.  “i did kind of think back a couple of days ago that i don’t think i was thinking in london that i would be swimming all this in rio,” ledecky said. “it’s crazy how fast things can happen and how much the hard work can pay off.”  in london, missy franklin counted the 4x200 freestyle relay as one of the four gold medals in her five-medal haul. four years later, she swam in the preliminaries and did not break 1:57. and so it was that franklin was left off the relay at night.            image        allison schmitt, leah smith, maya dirado and katie ledecky.   credit  jeffrey furticella/the new york times         filling the role of america’s can-do kid at these games is the 19-year-old ledecky. the youngest member of the u.s. swimming squad for the second straight games, she seems unflinching, undeterred, unstoppable. ledecky already has three golds and a relay silver and her best event, the 800-meter freestyle, is up next.  ledecky, hungary’s katinka hosszu and sweden’s sarah sjostrom have emerged as the stars on the women’s side at olympic aquatics stadium, and all three were in the relay final, but only ledecky and hosszu went head to head. sjostrom swam the third leg for sweden, which was seeking to medal in the event for the first time.

       " 'wabasha, minn. — in the weeks before the olympic cyclist kelly catlin killed herself, she felt her mind slipping.  she could not focus on her schoolwork at stanford, where she was a first-year graduate student in computational mathematics. in an email she sent to her family, a coach and a friend in january, she said her thoughts were “never-ending spinning, spinning, spinning” as if they were “never at rest, never at peace.”  she wrote that she cried about it, and that made her feel even worse. for years, catlin, 23, was someone who took pride in holding back tears.  catlin told her sister, christine, that seeking therapy meant she was weak and that she would rather suffer. she told her brother, colin, that she thought she was going insane and she worried that she was a danger to others because she was filled with rage.        she wrote that she was scared of dying.  “what is it like to no longer have a mind?” she wrote in january, just days before a first suicide attempt. she answered the question.  “it is unimaginable,” she wrote. “terrifying.”  catlin was poised for stardom at the 2020 olympics in tokyo, where she had a reasonable shot for olympic gold that eluded her in 2016. with the advanced degree from stanford she was working toward, she could have her pick of jobs in computers.  how, those who knew her are asking now, could she find no purpose to keep living? how could she be so unknown to the people closest to her?  kelly catlin had sought to explain herself and her distress, both over the phone and in notes before she was found dead in her stanford apartment on march 8. in one note she wrote in january, she even asked, “what do you wish to know?”, leaving a trail of cryptic answers.            image     kelly catlin’s brother, colin, sifts through the belongings retrieved from her graduate student apartment at stanford, hoping for clues explaining why she took her life last month at age 23.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         “you think you know your children,” her mother, carolyn emory, said, “but there was so much about kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end. she was very private.”        on friday, a month after she killed herself, a white van showed up at her parents’ farmhouse to drop off her things.  three bikes. nearly a dozen boxes of clothes, books and cycling gear. her carbon-fiber violin. duffel bags stuffed with cycling gear and united states olympic team uniforms from the 2016 rio games, where she won a silver medal.  her mother and her brother, colin catlin, sifted through the belongings, retrieved from her apartment. her father, dr. mark catlin, could only join them in spurts because he was so distraught.  every item provoked a memory, none a clue.  colin catlin had hoped to find telling information on her phone, but instead he found the wallpaper she selected for it haunting: an album cover featuring a body with daggers in its back. the album title was “try to die.”  he broke into tears.  it was hard to absorb that just months before, in november, on the podium at a world cup track cycling race, where catlin’s squad finished second in the team pursuit, she soaked in the moment: flags waving, fans cheering, adrenaline pumping. a three-time world champion, catlin considered the victory a prelude to finally winning an olympic gold medal.  off the track, she was fulfilling a lifelong obsession with numbers and order through her academics and planning for a career in silicon valley.        this solid trajectory she appeared to be on had made her mental downward spiral and death all the more mystifying to teammates, friends and family members.  catlin’s father, who is a pathologist, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries from a january suicide attempt about a month before she was found dead in her dorm. on both occasions, she inhaled noxious gas.            image        kelly catlin, second from the left, and her teammates celebrate a silver medal in the women’s team pursuit at the 2016 rio olympic games.   credit  bryn lennon/getty images         but the breaking point, he and other family members believe, was a concussion she sustained during a training ride on jan. 5. they have donated her brain to researchers to find out if the head injury contributed to her behavior changes.  regardless of the results, nothing can give the family a definitive answer. suicide is much more complicated than lab results can reveal and multiple factors, like destabilizing life events, brain chemistry and persistent mental struggles, almost always come into play.  “i wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,” said her father, whose eyes were reddened by weeks of crying. “i can’t help but wonder what she would’ve done with her life.”  kelly’s mother answered, weeping, “something great.”  ‘never love’  catlin and her triplet siblings, christine and colin, grew up in arden hills, minn., a suburb of minneapolis. her parents — her mother is a former alzheimer’s researcher — met in a lab dissecting brains.        the catlins lived in a large house with an indoor gymnasium. they took european vacations and roasted s’mores in the backyard. they were a family of introverts who enjoyed staying at home for tea parties. for kelly, christine and colin, school and sports were equally important. they excelled at both.  kelly was the super-focused athlete, a first-chair violinist who studied nonstop. christine was the creative writer and runner who played three instruments. colin was the math whiz who played guitar and rode bikes competitively. in middle school, the siblings tied for most likely to succeed.  “our parents always told us that we could be great at anything we wanted to, if we worked hard enough,” christine said. “looking back, maybe we kind of twisted that into thinking we weren’t worth anything if we weren’t the best. i think kelly believed that.”  kelly’s parents said she was an intense child who grew socially awkward with age. in elementary school, when she could not figure out addition or subtraction, she would scream for hours in frustration, they said, and refused to take a break.  for years in her youth, she was obsessed with horses. she studied the 512-page book “the ultimate book of the horse and rider” so much that she had to tape the binding because the book was so worn. she maintained a collection of dozens of model horses that she did not allow anyone to touch because they were arranged in a certain order.            image        “you think you know your children, but there was so much about kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end,” catlin’s mother, carolyn emory, said.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         christine catlin described her sister as a once outgoing, friendly girl who began closing herself off in middle school because she was “so obsessed with success.”        kelly catlin also began to limit her social interactions to “robotic social motions,” as catlin herself put it in the january note to family and friends. around third grade, catlin established her lifelong code to live by and included some of it in the note, which was shared with the new york times:   fear not physical discomfort. never love. never engage in a relationship that could be defined as having a significant other. (in my case, a so-called “boyfriend.”) never allow yourself to become close enough to another that their actions or inactions might cause you (any amount of) distress or pain. if kindness and gentleness are at all an option, they are the only option.    “we all knew that she didn’t like to express her emotions,” christine catlin said. “she never really told anyone how she ever felt, until the very end, that is.”  cycling calls  colin and christine catlin were cycling for a local development team, northstar, when kelly quit high school soccer and joined them, at colin’s prodding. she loved long training rides and used cycling as a way to practice memorization, another passion.  she would remember dozens of license plates of cars passing her and would recite the number pi to hundreds of decimals, colin catlin said. she mapped out training routes in her head.  “she liked that cycling kept her mind focused, but i think she liked it most when she started winning everything,” said colin, a data scientist. “her mentality was, if you wanted to be an olympian, all you had to do was train hard.”  and kelly did make it seem easy. within two years of starting to race, she was invited to the united states olympic training center in colorado, where coaches put cyclists through testing to see if they are national team material. kelly was that, and more.  her power output on the stationary bike was higher than every other recruit and higher than several athletes on the national track cycling team, said neal henderson, one of the coaches back then.        track cyclists compete on a banked oval, called a velodrome, and catlin seemed suited for it because it required both power and precision.            image        kelly catlin, second from left, with jennifer valente, chloe dygert and kimberly geist, during the women&rsquo;s team pursuit final at the world championships in march 2018. the u.s. team won the gold medal.   credit  peter dejong/associated press         she was drawn to the science of cycling. she wasn’t comfortable with the social aspect of it. in the notes she wrote in her final weeks, she acknowledged not having many friends.  “it’s not that she didn’t want friends,” her brother said. “it was just a matter of priorities. and her priority was to be successful and respected.”  like her siblings, catlin could not stand to be hugged, family members said. she would rather bury herself in a book than chat with peers. she had a playful sense of humor — often dark humor — within her family circle, but rarely showed it to outsiders.  although she exuded confidence, she described in a note having a “phenomenally powerful fear of social embarrassment,” and also long worried that she would not be able to keep up with other cyclists, said charlie and sherry townsend, the co-founders of her development team. it was a classic impostor syndrome, they said.  “but she changed because of cycling, she really did,” said sherry townsend, a psychologist, adding that catlin’s self-esteem rose after she competed in the olympics. “she was slowly learning how to be better engaged with people, slowly learning how to share her thoughts with others. but it was still hard to really know her.”        catlin’s nickname at the olympic training center, where she lived before the 2016 olympics, was roy orbison, because she always wore dark glasses. she wore her hair short because it was practical for the sport, so short that she was sometimes mistaken for a young man.  chloé dygert, an olympic teammate, said she was thrilled when catlin started to open up, even occasionally agreeing to a quick hug. dygert and a teammate once convinced catlin to play the violin for them.  “it was, like, whoa, so good that it was jaw-dropping,” dygert said. “kelly was just amazing. she read a book every day, even while brushing her teeth, and it was hard to keep up. she was a lovely girl on the inside.”  a concussion, then changes  the concussion that her family said changed everything happened on jan. 5 when catlin crashed while riding with her professional road cycling team, rally uhc cycling. a team spokesman said there was “no indication that she hit her head or had a serious injury” when the team evaluated her.            image        catlin’s father, dr. mark catlin, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         but at a national team training camp two days later, catlin felt dizzy and could not continue working out. she told the team about her crash. medical personnel at the olympic training center placed her on concussion protocol and suggested rest, said guillermo rojas, a spokesman for usa cycling.  yet catlin continued to complain to her parents of headaches, sensitivity to light and trouble sleeping. and this was coming months after a fall in october that left her with a broken arm and weakened interest in the national team.        “there was this profound apathy,” her father said. “she didn’t care about winning medals anymore.”  life at stanford was much different than she was used to. she moved into a dorm there after living with her brother at the university of minnesota while finishing her undergraduate degree. colin had cooked her meals and often had to trick her into taking breaks from studying and training, playing episodes of the television show “stargate” because she could not resist science fiction.  at stanford, she spent a lot of time alone because her roommate, a law student, was often not there.  after the concussion, catlin simply could not focus anymore on school or cycling — or anything. in late january, she wrote that she had started planning her suicide before her crash and concussion. but her family thinks that was not true.  “for the first time in her life, miss stoical couldn’t force herself to go on,” her father said, choking up. “this is when she began planning her suicide.”  after her first suicide attempt, catlin spent about a week in a hospital psychiatric ward. when she left that treatment, she began attending group therapy sessions, which she deemed useless, her parents said, and she said she could not find an available psychiatrist who met her needs.  when catlin moved back into her on-campus apartment, her parents flew home to minnesota to give her space, telling her, “we love you, we want you alive,” her father said. they banked on her assurances that she wouldn’t try to kill herself again. she had given her word, a part of her personal code they knew.  “she fooled us all,” her mother said.  the suicide attempt and concussion had damaged her brain and heart, her family said, so competing at the world championships on feb. 27 was not possible. the day the championships began, catlin wrote a blog post in which she described managing her cycling career with her graduate studies as “juggling with knives” and said, “i really am dropping a lot of them.” in a note she wrote in march, she said, “if i am not an athlete, i am nothing.”            image        kelly catlin’s grave at lakewood cemetery in minneapolis.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         looking back, her father said, it was clear she needed time for her brain to heal, but it appeared nobody could impress that on her.  he said her lifelong resolve played a big factor in trying to kill herself again.  “she was furious that she survived her first suicide attempt,” her father said.  a last call  christine catlin’s phone rang in late february, and it was kelly. they had not spoken at length in years because they were busy with their own lives after high school, but now kelly wanted to talk. christine found it strange. it was nothing kelly would have done before her concussion.  kelly said she worried that the physical effects of her concussion or her first suicide attempt — or both — were affecting her judgment.  she asked: what could christine see her doing in the future?  the sister answered: you could do public speaking about suicide awareness and help people. or you could do remote computer programming so you don’t have to be around people. you could own a farm and be around horses all day.  “you could bike, if you want to,” christine said. “or not.”  kelly seemed to feel better after the call, which lasted two and a half hours.        still, she told christine, “if things don’t change in a month, i’m probably going to kill myself.”  christine begged kelly not to do it.  “o.k.,” kelly said, with a tone christine now realizes was less than convincing.  the call was over. christine rushed to call her parents, and for days afterward the family repeatedly checked on kelly. two weeks after that conversation, catlin’s life was over.  at a memorial service in minneapolis on march 23, kelly catlin was dressed in the uniform the united states team wore for the rio games opening ceremony, and the majority of her pallbearers were her cycling teammates. she was buried at the foot of a 50-foot oak tree at lakewood cemetery, near one of her favorite bike paths.  before the coffin was closed, her sister, christine, slipped in a handwritten note that included these words:   kelly, if i could trade my life for yours, i would. i love you

       " 'moscow — president vladimir v. putin blamed politics for the doping scandal that has led to the barring of more than 100 russian athletes from the coming rio games, saying that the absence of some russian athletes will devalue the medals of other olympians and render their victories “tasteless.”  speaking in one of the grand halls of the kremlin on wednesday, mr. putin told members of the russian olympic team, including those barred from rio, that they fell victim to “double standards” imposed by “shortsighted politicians.”  as a result, the level of competition will be reduced and the summer games will be less of a spectacle, he said, according to a transcript published on the kremlin’s website.  “it is one thing to win in competition with your equals, with strong rivals, after all, and quite another thing to compete against athletes clearly not of your level,” mr. putin said. “such a victory does not have the same taste and is perhaps even quite tasteless.”        a total of 108 russians have been barred from the olympics so far, including 67 of 68 members of the track and field team. russia planned to send 387 athletes to the games.  the international olympic committee was urged by athletes and antidoping officials to bar the entire russian team after  an investigation confirmed  a pervasive state-sponsored doping scheme. but olympics officials  instead chose to defer  that decision to individual sports federations.  mr. putin promised that russia would treat the barred athletes as olympic champions, “with all the administrative and financial consequences this entails.”            image     members of the russian olympic team in red square after attending a ceremony at the kremlin.   credit  yuri kochetkov/european pressphoto agency         in january, the russian government ruled that gold medalists in rio de janeiro would receive 4 million rubles each, or $60,000.        yelena isinbayeva, a pole-vaulter who is among the track and field athletes barred from the games, could not hide her tears in her speech that followed mr. putin’s.  “they took from us the goal that had kept us going and motivated us to keep pushing our own limits every day,” said mrs. isinbayeva, two-time olympic champion and the current world-record holder in pole vault. “today we faced such lawlessness, injustice and complacency from certain people in the sports world, who do whatever they want under the rules that they created themselves.”  following the meeting, russian athletes went to one of the kremlin’s ancient cathedrals, where patriarch kirill i, the head of the russian orthodox church, conducted a farewell service.  despite blaming political conspiracy for the current situation, russia announced measures to improve its antidoping efforts.  last week, the russian olympic committee created a special antidoping commission that will develop a national plan to fight doping. high-ranking russian officials, including mr. putin and sports minister vitaly l. mutko, pledged russia’s commitment to clean sports.  on thursday, russia will hold a track meet for its team in moscow in which some of the barred athletes will compete.        among the athletes at the meet will be sergei shubenkov, the 110-meter hurdles world champion, and ivan s. ukhov, the 2012 high jump olympic gold medalist.  after boycotting the 1984 los angeles olympics, the soviet union and other eastern european countries hosted a so-called friendship games for athletes who had missed out, including such stars as the boxer teofilo stevenson and the runner alberto juantorena of cuba and the sprinters marlies gohr and marita koch of east germany.

       " 'rio de janeiro — brazil became the most decorated nation in olympic soccer last week, winning its eighth medal saturday and its first gold when the men’s team defeated germany in a shootout.  as the team celebrates, the man who oversaw its run through the competition faces criminal charges. with an outstanding warrant for his arrest, he has made himself scarce outside brazil.  that man, marco polo del nero, the president of brazil’s soccer federation, was  indicted  by the united states department of justice on an array of corruption charges in 2015. of the  dozens  of soccer officials charged in the case, mr. del nero is the only one still in power. and in a country that extradites its citizens only for drug crimes, he has not just remained a free man, but also a prominent figure at the rio games.  brazil was implicated in an outsize way in the global soccer corruption case. including mr. del nero, six defendants are brazilian, the most of any country.        “the case has been bad for brazil’s reputation,” walter feldman, mr. del nero’s deputy, said in an interview here in april.  standing outside the nation’s soccer headquarters — a glassy building named after josé maria marin, another indicted brazilian official, who was apprehended in switzerland and is now under house arrest at trump tower in manhattan — mr. feldman said, “we’re used to a different system of justice, and we hope the american authorities end things soon.”  they have not.  nearly 10 of mr. del nero’s former colleagues from around the world are awaiting trial in brooklyn, which is expected next year. international authorities remain on alert for mr. del nero and others, in case they travel outside their home countries.         rounding the bend in rio     12 photos  view slide show  ›          image          james hill for the new york times      here in brazil, mr. del nero is proceeding with business as usual, and this summer, that business has centered on the olympics and brazil’s high-profile pursuit of gold.        mr. del nero is not the first person facing criminal charges to endure in world sport, and he is not the only one in the spotlight of the rio games.  the late joão havelange, another sports power broker, was honored at the games last week. mr. havelange, a predecessor of mr. del nero’s in brazil who from 1974 to 1998 went on to lead fifa, soccer’s global governing body, was later implicated in a scandal involving millions of dollars in kickbacks from a world cup marketing firm.  a longtime member of the international olympic committee, he denied the accusations but resigned from that post in 2011 before an ethics investigation concluded, pre-empting a possible suspension and putting an end to the inquiry.  after mr. havelange  died  in rio on tuesday at 100, the olympic committee lowered brazilian flags to half-staff in his honor. an olympic spokesman called questions about corruption on the day of mr. havelange’s death inappropriate.  “mr. havelange was a very important person to brazilian sport,” said mario andrada, a spokesman for the organizers of the rio games. “that doesn’t mean we are blind to history or facts.”   sepp blatter , the former fifa president whose own reign ended amid scandal last year, said in a phone interview last week that he hoped brazil would win a gold medal for mr. havelange, who had been instrumental in bringing the games to rio.        “they have bronze and they have silver, but they have never had gold,” said mr. blatter, who was following the olympics from switzerland. “now they are in the final for havelange.” mr. blatter said he had spoken by phone with mr. havelange 10 days before he died.            decisive moments at the rio olympics, frame by frame  see the summer games in a series of composite images.       he had not, however, spoken with mr. del nero — the man for whom brazil was technically playing on saturday — since the brazilian fled zurich on “one of these dramatic days of arrests last year,” mr. blatter said.  although the new leadership of fifa is seeking to project an image of reform in the face of government scrutiny, mr. del nero and mr. havelange are not shunned figures.  gianni infantino, fifa’s president, expressed gratitude to mr. havelange in a  statement  last week. days before, mr. infantino met with mr. del nero in brazil; smiling, the men posed for  several pictures  together, in one of them holding up a brazil jersey bearing mr. infantino’s name.  through a spokeswoman, mr. infantino said he had not visited rio “to evaluate the c.b.f.’s management model or its president,” using the abbreviation by which the brazilian federation is known. he added, through the spokeswoman, “we did not talk about investigations or procedures within fifa or any other entity.”  fifa’s ethics committee opened its own investigation into mr. del nero after the united states filed charges against him, according to a fifa spokesman, but no disciplinary action has been taken.  “in the culture, you have morals, but the morals can change,” mr. blatter said, reflecting on how perceptions of people in power changed over time.        he said he was pleased that the olympic stadium here, where the track and field competitions have taken place, would again be named for mr. havelange after the games.  “there are heroes at one time that are no longer heroes now,” mr. blatter said, noting that he, himself, had schools and soccer fields across continents named after him.  ”let history decide if it’s good or not good,” he said.  mr. blatter added, “like in football, the game is not over until the referee blows the final whistle.”       ',\n",
       " 'a dozen years ago, the university of washington barred athletic coaches from having contact with anyone in the admissions department.  with a move that now seems prescient, two new administrators supervising athletics sought to allay any concerns that coaches could put undue pressure on admissions personnel. the change also brought more oversight to athletics, in this case through a committee of senior faculty members, deans and other university representatives.  the previous arrangement, said philip ballinger, an associate vice provost now overseeing admissions, “didn’t have sufficient transparency; it didn’t have enough eyes on it.”  the leeway coaches get in recruiting has long been a point of discussion in higher education circles. but after federal investigators last week revealed a broad admissions cheating scandal, a number of colleges began asking hard questions about how they evaluate athletic applicants and oversee the chosen few whom coaches recommend for admission.        in what prosecutors described as the biggest case of admissions fraud they had investigated,  50 people were accused  in a scheme that involved paying bribes to coaches and to people who monitor admissions tests in order to fraudulently get the children of wealthy patrons into some of the nation’s most elite colleges.  some students were accepted as recruited athletes even though they did not play the sports described in their applications. they gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admissions spots to athletes who might not get in otherwise.  this process has been followed for decades in the pursuit of competitive teams, which burnish a university’s reputation, inspire alumni loyalty and often help with fund-raising.            image     rudy meredith, who was the yale women’s soccer coach until november, has been accused of accepting money to participate in college admissions fraud.   credit  doug engle/star-banner, via associated press         now, the fraud case has sent a thunderbolt through the higher education community.  “every college president in america called his athletic director the morning after that admissions fraud story broke and asked: how do we make sure this doesn’t happen at our school?” said bill martin, the athletic director at the university of michigan from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. “and certain athletic directors were smart enough to call their presidents first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athlete.”        indeed, at yale university, where f.b.i. investigators say the longtime women’s soccer coach accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer, the university president, peter salovey, announced late last week that new oversight policies had already been put in place. the yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit’s credentials before admission, and recruited athletes who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive “close scrutiny,” a university statement said.  a broad overhaul of athletic admissions systems in division i, the highest level of n.c.a.a. competition and the level the colleges in the scheme compete in, has been overdue, according to several athletic administrators interviewed in recent days.  battles over blue-chip recruits in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized. in those upper echelon sports, if there is money changing hands, it is from coaches to recruits, not the other way around.  but in the lower-profile sports like crew, volleyball, tennis and soccer — often called the olympic sports — there has been more room for bribes and exploitation. and the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect as a “recruited walk-on.” in nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credentials cited in last week’s indictments, from stanford to texas to yale, the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walk-on.  such applicants are not even assured a spot on the team. but they are often on a list of five to 20 athletes — it varies from sport to sport — that a coach is permitted to submit to the admissions department.  the two daughters of the actress lori loughlin, who was charged in connection with the fraud case last week, were passed off as crew recruits despite never having competed in the sport, according to federal prosecutors.        that choice of sport may not have been an accident. in a sport like women’s crew, where rosters can balloon to 125 athletes, many teams have scores of recruited walk-ons. (such large rosters can help a college comply with federal equality laws, balancing out the number of male athletes in football.)            image        william singer, who prosecutors say was the leader of the admissions cheating scheme, has pleaded guilty to charges related to the fraud.   credit  katherine taylor for the new york times         “when the rosters are that big, like they are in women’s crew, i could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person as a recruited walk-on,” said martin, who added that michigan annually audited team rosters.  the recruitment of athletes in such sports may be an even bigger factor in the admissions process at colleges in the n.c.a.a.’s lowest tier, division iii, where athletic scholarships are forbidden.  division iii is also the largest tier, with nearly 450 institutions, including many of the country’s most selective small liberal arts colleges, where acceptance rates can be as low as 15 percent. these colleges might field as many as 30 teams from enrollments as small as 2,000, with varsity athletes, many of them afforded an advantage in admissions, making up 30 percent to 45 percent of the student body.  these small colleges, like the largest ones, also give preferential treatment to applicants who excel in music, the arts and a host of other skills. there are also allowances for students from the least-populated states.  “admissions is filling all the different buckets,” said wendy smith, the athletic director at haverford college, a highly rated institution near philadelphia. “and our athletes are right in there. we are not in any way gaming the system. they are absolutely on par academically.”  the cost of fielding a successful sports team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads to other troubling conflicts of interest.        in the ivy league, for example, most coaches are responsible for fund-raising that bridges the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully. that can lead to uncomfortable decisions about composing a team, especially since athletes’ families often become the leading donors.  “you have a family who will give you $25,000, but then you are not going to play their daughter?” said paul wardlaw, who was the women’s tennis coach at brown university for 14 years.            image        the university of southern california was one of the schools at the center of a college admissions scandal.   credit  rozette rago for the new york times         “the whole scandal is interesting, and it’s human nature to take the easy route,” he said, “but there are some systematic issues that are contributing to this.”  at many elite institutions, the notion that recruited athletes have been granted an unfair advantage is palpable.  cameron green, a tight end on the football team at northwestern university, which accepts about 13 percent of applicants, conceded that several of his high school classmates who did not play sports had applied to northwestern and been rejected.  “it’s easier for athletes to get in, so i know that’s hard for regular students,” said green, a senior who does not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility. “a lot of kids i knew were confused when i got in and they didn’t, but you know, at the end of the day, the school looks at your demographics on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet you.”        the high percentage of recruited athletes at some colleges, particularly smaller ones, has other consequences, some of them at odds with institutional ambitions for a diverse student body.  because success in youth sports today often comes more easily to affluent families who spend copiously on private instruction, the rosters of college teams have become predominantly white — nearly 80 percent at some small schools.  in the end, some in the higher education community believe that last week’s admissions fraud scandal, while an embarrassing lesson in what policy changes need to be made, is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admissions procedures at american colleges.  “there is now this notion that admissions is a competitive cesspool, and it’s not,” said michael reilly, the executive director of the american association of college registrars and admissions officers. “in fact,” reilly added, “most campuses nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goals. but then we have this segment that’s highly competitive and has created a completely different dynamic. if i were on those campuses, i’d be sitting down and saying, ‘let’s rethink how we’re doing this.’”       ',\n",
       " 'this is a short list. hundreds of athletes are truly spectacular at their sport and routinely blow our minds with feats of skill. but our goal this year was to highlight the very few who, through innovation, vision or just plain courage, actually changed how others in their sport viewed or played the game.   we have probably missed somebody, so please let us know who you think should

zurga/associated press             by   ben shpigel       on the second monday in october, i walked down the basement steps of a house in kansas city, mo., to find chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes staring at me.  not the corporeal version but rather his likeness in two dimensions, painted on a wall in bob green’s home that is reserved for kansas city sporting luminaries. green asked an artist friend to add mahomes to the mural in mid-september.        it was three starts into mahomes’s career.  “i assume he will make the hall of fame, you know,” green said.  mahomes, at 23, is the best player on the best offense on the top-seeded team in the a.f.c., in a season in which teams are on pace to score the second-most points in n.f.l. history. he threw for the second-most yards in the league this season, 5,097, and the most touchdowns, 50, since 2013, when peyton manning set the single-season record with 55.  mobile, strong-armed and touched with a remarkable capacity for completing throws others wouldn’t dare attempt, mahomes does not represent the new prototype for the position so much as the ideal for how football is played in 2018 and perhaps beyond: directing a creative scheme rooted in college spread concepts with devastating efficiency.  his game film is crammed with highlights demonstrating an aptitude for improvising in the truest sense of the word. he employs his awareness and feel to create something new, different, better. magic johnson did it. steph curry does it. it’s what sublime athletes do. mahomes is operating within the same confines that have governed football for decades — a 100-yard field, surrounded by 21 other players — but playing quarterback in a way that seems purely individualistic.        his no-look throws, his sidearm flips, his left-handed flicks — they all, at least to me, evoke the premise of “chopped,” the reality show on the food network, in which contestants are given baskets of mystery ingredients and must prepare meals. instead of, say, merging kohlrabi, baby octopus, black plums and animal crackers to create a sumptuous dinner, mahomes processes all that is around him and of him — pass rushers, decaying protection, his own body positioning — and just reacts.          “he shows no fear,” the espn analyst louis riddick said in a recent interview. “that plays into our society right now. be your own guy. be an individual. take risks, take chances — that’s him. but he doesn’t do it in a way that seems reckless. he just seems to do it in a way that, really, his teammates want him to do it, and it makes them better.”  the chiefs, to a degree, anticipated all of this when they traded up to draft mahomes in 2017. after sitting him for most of last season, the chiefs unleashed mahomes against the poor chargers in week 1. he threw for four touchdowns in a game that, with the benefit of hindsight, doesn’t even rank among his best.  he flummoxed the steelers in pittsburgh with six touchdowns. facing a 10-point deficit in denver with less than 7 minutes left, he orchestrated two late scoring drives. in a loss, he dinged the rams for 478 yards and six touchdowns.  more recently, in week 14, mahomes deflated the ravens with a pass that analysis does no justice.  it was fourth-and-9 at the chiefs’ 40-yard line, 89 seconds remaining, with kansas city trailing by 7. flushed out of the pocket, mahomes sprinted right, then a bit upfield while being trailed by two defenders. near the sideline, he released a throw across his body that traveled, according to the n.f.l.’s next gen stats, 43.6 yards in the air. the ball eluded two ravens defenders and another converging on tyreek hill before nestling in his arms at the far hash mark, by baltimore’s 28-yard line. on the cbs broadcast, tony romo about yelped.          success breeds success, but it also breeds imitation. desultory teams want the next mahomes, but what if there isn’t one? that’s not hyperbole, just reasonable conjecture.        in 2018, mahomes is an outlier in a league hustling to adapt to him. and he’s here to stay.  the painting is on the wall.   snowboarding  chloe kim: the trailblazer            image         credit  margaret cheatham williams/the new york times             by   john branch       the tweet came in the middle of the gold medal competition, a podium-worthy trick in itself. chloe kim, then 17 and considered the best female halfpipe snowboarder by those who pay attention to such things, was about to become a global star.  “wish i finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now i’m getting hangry,” she typed, then sent.  not a deep thought, but a relatable one; news of her pangs zipped silently through the crisp, mountain air to her then-15,000 twitter followers, a modest number for a teenager who is the best in the world at something as cool as snowboarding.  kim then made serious noise by stomping the competition. she twisted and flipped and smiled her way to the bottom, upending and resetting the standard for her event, landing at the top of the sports world.  by the end of that sunny february day at the pyeongchang olympics, kim had a gold medal, 150,000 twitter followers and the type of crossover appeal that makes fans swoon and marketers salivate.        the olympics usually make comets out of their best athletes, not stars. they are flares that burn out of sight quickly or, with luck and momentum, circle around and attract our attention every four years.  kim is different. fueled by her breakout performance, a day plus a lifetime in the making, she shows no sign of fading from sight.  in july, she was awarded the espy for best female athlete. earlier this month, in copper mountain, colo., she won the season’s first world cup competition as emphatically as she won at the winter games. then she did it again the next weekend at a major event in nearby breckenridge.  back in february, amid the hunger-game tweeting at the olympic finals, kim scored 93.75 points out of 100 on the first of her three runs. no one else in the competition approached the mark. when it came time for her last run, with all other gold medal hopefuls vanquished,  she let loose  to “one-up myself,” she said.  the run scored 98.25 and featured back-to-back 1080s, far more punctuation than she ever puts in a tweet. kim was the first woman to pair three 360-degree spins off one wall, then the other, back in 2016. and the only one, at the 2018 olympics, with the nerve to try it and the talent to do it.  she is a paradigm buster in a sport with few rules. a cross between kelly clark, the most-dominant female halfpipe rider for most of 20 years, and shaun white, the charismatic crossover celebrity who found the halfpipe to be a launch point for fame and fortune.  kim grew up watching, and competing against, the pioneers of the sport — people like clark, gretchen bleiler and torah bright. she was raised on the cool conscience of the sport, but it became clear quite early that she was a rare talent. she would have made the olympics in 2014, and been a favorite to win, when she was 13, but she was three years too young to qualify.        now 18, she is an insider with outsized talent. she is compact — 5 feet 2 inches and 115 pounds, a bit like a gymnast or a sprinter or any other athlete that blends power and speed. she has style, snowboarding’s term for riding with understated flair and cool ease. but she flies higher than other women, twists more and comes up biggest in the biggest contests.  and she has the guts to tweet about hunger pains while doing it.  kim is the californian daughter of korean immigrants. her father,   jong jin kim ,  came from south korea in 1982 with $800 and a korean-english dictionary. he worked at fast-food restaurants and liquor stores, took some college classes and became an engineer.  chloe was born in 2000, a child of a new century. her father put her on a snowboard at age 4, and they learned how to ride together. people saw her potential every step of the way. she turned 11 in 2011, when the 2018 winter olympics were awarded to south korea.  her father did the math. perfect.  that’s why the bottom of the olympics halfpipe was a perfect mash of person and place. as kim navigated the crowd to find her family, her eyes filled with tears. so did her father&#x27;s. so did a lot of people’s.  just a bit earlier, at the time that chloe kim was tweeting about her breakfast sandwich from the top of the halfpipe,  her father stood at the bottom  in nervous anticipation. he held a crinkled, handwritten sign. next to a big red heart, it read, “go chloe!”  she’s going.   baseball  ryne stanek: the opener            image         credit  mike carlson/getty images             by   tyler kepner       the tampa bay rays turned the pitcher’s mound into a laboratory in 2018. they had spent much of last winter trading expensive veterans, and their wealthy division rivals in boston and the bronx seemed destined to dominate the american league. why not blow up tradition and see what happened?        “so many people tried to destroy us for doing it, which was kind of funny,” pitcher ryne stanek said this month in the bustling lobby of the mandalay bay resort and casino in las vegas, where he was attending baseball’s winter meetings. “a lot of fans just didn’t understand the logic behind it.”  now they do. the rays astonished the industry by surging to 90 victories, helped largely by “the opener,” a position they created in which the first pitcher of the game works only an inning or two. before may 19 — when they unveiled the plan with the veteran reliever  sergio romo  — the rays ranked 22nd in the majors in earned run average, at 4.43. from then on, they ranked third, at 3.50.  stanek made 29 starts yet pitched only 40 innings in those games. at one point he set a major league record with nine consecutive scoreless starts, though he pitched just 13⅔ innings in that span. the former all-star orel hershiser — who shared the previous record, with six — says the game itself has not changed, but game  theory  has changed quite a bit. stanek, whose unusual rookie season symbolized that, wholeheartedly agrees.  “it’s about: how can you use your good players better to win more games?” stanek said. “every player, you just want to win games, and whatever way we can do that, that’s what we want to do.”  before the season, the rays had planned to build a bullpen day into their rotation, with several pitchers sharing the load once every five games. they began the year with four traditional starters, and one of them, blake snell, would go 21-5 and win the a.l. cy young award. but when injuries and trades depleted the other reliable options, the rays dove into data for something different.  teams score more runs in the first inning than in any other inning, largely because they stack their best hitters at the top. the rays tried to counteract that by starting a pitcher with dominant stuff, then using another — the “bulk guy,” they called it — for multiple innings. that bulk guy was typically young and could benefit from facing easier hitters at the start of his longer outing, and the opener would be fresh enough to do it again the next day, if needed.  “when i first heard it, i was like, ‘there’s no way that’s sustainable,’” stanek said. “but then you start looking at the way the innings break down, and you’re like, ‘it doesn’t really change anything. if you’re going to have your starter go five, and i would throw the sixth, why does it matter if i throw the first and he throws the next five innings to get it through the sixth regardless?’”        stanek, 27, was a starter at the university of arkansas and in the minors. he liked to approach hitters with his best stuff right away; no conserving for later innings, a mind-set ideally suited to shorter stints. his fastball reached 100 miles an hour in his first try as the opener, on may 26, and he struck out 53 in those 40 innings, with a 3.38 earned run average in the role.  from his first start through the end of the season, stanek made five more starts than any other pitcher in the majors. he wonders how truly bizarre his stat line would seem if he had gotten going earlier.  “i had times when i started three times in a week,” stanek said. “i’m like, ‘i could have gotten 50, maybe.’”  no pitcher has made 50 starts since 1904, when the yankees’  jack chesbro  made 51 while throwing more than 400 innings. those days are long gone. with so many strong arms available in relief — and stats showing a decrease in pitchers’ effectiveness the more times hitters face them — only 13 pitchers worked 200 innings in 2018, the fewest ever in a full season.  the opener idea is not going away. the oakland athletics and the milwaukee brewers used it in the playoffs. the minnesota twins and the toronto blue jays hired managers from the tampa bay coaching staff. stanek and the rays have started — well, opened — a very logical trend.  “if it gives you a chance to win more games than you lose,” stanek said, “there’s no reason why people wouldn’t do it.”         gymnastics  rachael denhollander: the hero            image         credit  jeff kowalsky/agence france-presse — getty images             by   juliet macur       do you know who stopped dr. lawrence g. nassar, the former united states gymnastics national team doctor who is now infamous as the face of sexual assault in sports?  not u.s.a. gymnastics. not michigan state, where nassar saw patients at a clinic and molested them for decades under the guise of medical treatment.  not even the f.b.i., which in the summer of 2015 learned of the accusations against nassar and proceeded to plod along in an investigation — if it can be described as that, considering it didn’t contact the main witness for nearly 11 months.  so many people or entities had the chance to stop nassar from hurting girls and women. but credit rachael denhollander, a former club gymnast turned lawyer, for finally making it happen and for subsequently making olympic sports safer.  denhollander, 33, was the first person to publicly accuse nassar of sexual assault. her powerful voice sparked real institutional action against him and has saved lives.  without her, it is possible that u.s.a. gymnastics would still be actively working to bury sexual misconduct accusations against its coaches. and it is likely congress would not be demanding change in how the united states olympic committee and olympic sports’ national governing bodies deal with sexual misconduct cases.  for years, in many olympic sports, misconduct cases languished within the sports organizations that inexplicably did not automatically report all cases to law enforcement. now, because of the nassar case, it’s a federal crime to fail to report sexual assault in olympic sports.        without denhollander, it is also possible that the hundreds of young girls and women nassar molested over the years would still be suffering in silence.  “you made this happen,” judge rosemarie aquilina told denhollander in january at one of nassar’s sentencing hearings, where denhollander was the 156th, and final, one of nassar’s victims  to provide a witness statement . “you are the bravest person i’ve ever had in my courtroom.”  in the summer of 2016, denhollander read an indianapolis star story detailing how u.s.a. gymnastics, for years, had mishandled sexual assault reports. it was her cue to finally come forward with her painful secret.  “it wasn’t something i wanted to do because of the fear and the risk behind it, but it was something i knew i had to do,” she told the new york times in february. “i didn’t want larry nassar to hurt one more child. i felt a responsibility to at least try to stop him.”  denhollander contacted the indianapolis star and said nassar had molested her when she was 15. the newspaper published her story in september 2016, when nassar was still working at michigan state. he had been let go from u.s.a. gymnastics more than a year earlier.  she also filed a complaint against nassar with the michigan state police and a title ix complaint with the university.  michigan state relieved nassar of his clinical duties a day after denhollander filed her police complaint. about a week after her story ran in the indianapolis star, michigan state fired him.        by the end of 2016, nassar was in jail on federal child pornography charges.  since then, michigan state has settled with nassar’s victims — more than 300 of them and counting — for $500 million. u.s.a. gymnastics has entirely new leadership, and it, along with the u.s.o.c., is instituting reforms to keep athletes safer. congress, the indiana attorney general’s office, the justice department and other entities are trying to figure out who enabled nassar and his crimes and attempting to make them accountable.  nassar is in prison, serving a 40-to-175-year sentence for a multitude of sex crimes.  at his sentencing hearing in january, denhollander faced her molester. the judge described her as “a five-star general” of an army of abuse survivors. the public remained rapt as denhollander spoke and asked the court, again and again, “how much is a little girl worth?”  for the sports world, that answer wasn’t clear until denhollander reminded them that a little girl is worth everything.  at the very least, as she pointed out, that little girl is worth protecting.   running  eliud kipchoge: the record breaker            image         credit  maja hitij/getty images             by   scott cacciola       after eliud kipchoge ran the berlin marathon in 2 hours 1 minute 39 seconds to obliterate the world record in september, a lot of people tried really hard to comprehend what he had done.  it wasn’t easy, but perhaps the best example of this came a few weeks later at the chicago marathon, where attendees of the pre-race exposition were invited to hop on an enormous treadmill and somehow stay aboard while running at a speed of 13 miles an hour — which is really fast. it is also roughly the pace that kipchoge maintained for the entirety of his record run in berlin. the people at the marathon expo were being asked to do it for just 200 meters, which worked out to about 35 seconds.  easy, right? wrong.  the results were hilarious. most of the people who attempted the treadmill experiment tumbled in spectacular fashion, often after just seconds of sprinting all out. and their post-wipeout reactions went something like this:  kipchoge did this for 26.2 miles? impossible.          but sure enough, he did — and the running community is still buzzing about it.  it was a cool fall morning in berlin when kipchoge, a kenyan who is now 34, set such a blistering pace — covering the opening 10 kilometers in just over 29 minutes — that two of his three pacesetters had to drop out about 15 minutes later. the third peeled off halfway through the race, leaving kipchoge to fend for himself for the final 13-plus miles. he made it look effortless.  at 5 feet 6 inches and about 115 pounds, kipchoge skimmed along the pavement with smooth, metronomic strides, breaking the previous record held by dennis kimetto, a fellow kenyan, by 78 seconds — and defeating the second-place finisher by nearly 5 minutes.  but most remarkable was that his performance was almost expected. in 2017, at a nonsanctioned event sponsored by nike, kipchoge attempted to break two hours with the aid of pacesetters on a race car track in italy, only to miss by 25 seconds. it seemed a foregone conclusion that he would smash the world record on a sanctioned course given ideal conditions, and he delivered in berlin, averaging 4:38.4 per mile. his average 5-kilometer pace was 14:24.9, and process this: he did more than eight of those consecutively.  adding to his growing status as a living legend, kipchoge is  something of a philosopher . he reads biographies and keeps a journal. he runs with monastic self-discipline in the hills not far from his hometown in kenya, but he told me when i met with him in berlin the week before his record run that he never overextends himself in training. instead, he said, he reserves his full effort — all 100 percent of himself — for race day, which is a strategy that runs counter to the no-pain, no-gain attitude of so many distance runners.  “i want to run with a relaxed mind,” he said.  the reigning olympic marathon champion, kipchoge has now won 10 of the 11 marathons he has entered, and he told me that he would love to run the new york city marathon someday. (race organizers would love to have him, of course.)  it is a sign of the times that doping suspicions tend to trail the best athletes — especially when that athlete is a true outlier like kipchoge, and also when several other kenyan runners have been caught — but he has steadfastly denied using performance-enhancing drugs, and he has never failed a test for banned substances.  so we are left with his body of work, which is unlike anything the marathon world has ever seen. we can only imagine what he will do next.         skiing  ester ledecka: the crossover            image         credit  chang w. lee/the new york times             by   christopher clarey       before she changed the sense of what was possible in winter sports, ester ledecka had to make it clear that no one could change her mind.  from an early age, she was intent on being an alpine skier  and  snowboarder. by the time she reached her teens, she knew she wanted to be an  olympic  skier and snowboarder, too.  that plan met with plenty of resistance and skepticism from coaches and other experts, who were convinced that she would only be able to excel in one sport at the highest level.  but there she was in pyeongchang in february, winning gold medals in both for the czech republic — although not live on nbc, which was under the mistaken impression that the suspense was over and cut away from the super-g competition to other coverage before she could schuss down the mountain and shush the premature celebrations for another skier.  her  victory in the women’s super-g  was one of the biggest surprises in olympic history — she had never finished on the podium in a world cup ski race — but what came next was deeply impressive in a different register.  rather than get rattled by the fallout from her upset, she kept her focus and balance and won the gold medal she was expected to win in pyeongchang: the parallel giant slalom in snowboarding.        skiers and snowboarders, so often divided into different tribes, were united in admiration. so what will it take for another polymath to follow in her tracks?  “courage, because a lot of people will tell them not to do it,” ledecka said in a recent telephone interview from val gardena, italy. “i hope after what i’ve achieved, it will be less people, because they will realize it’s possible to do two sports at an elite level. and it doesn’t need to be sports. it could be art or whatever.  “but this is the most crucial thing: a lot of people will push you away from your way, your way to the top. and this is what i never had in my mind. i never cared about these people, because i always went for my dreams. and if someone loves these two sports as much as me and is able to start from a young age and work hard for it, then it is possible for sure.”  ledecka, now 23, had undeniable advantages, including an affluent family that could support dual-track training in her youth. her father, janek ledecky, is a prominent czech musician. but she also had exceptional commitment and talent, and for now she remains a unicorn as she shuttles between world cup events in alpine skiing and snowboarding.  “what she did was amazing, and if you saw our coverage, then you know we did not properly deliver on her story or accomplishment,” said steve porino, a former ski racer and longtime nbc skiing reporter. “she did not just show up and borrow a pair of mikaela shiffrin’s skis, as we made it sound in our short tv window. she busted her tail as both an alpine skier and snowboarder her entire life. as her dad told me, ‘the only thing we ever had to tell her to do was sleep.’”  but even ledecka faces logistics she cannot conquer. she intended to compete at the world championships in both snowboarding and alpine skiing in 2019. but the final rounds of the parallel giant slalom in snowboarding are on feb. 4 in park city, utah, and the super-g race in alpine skiing is on feb. 5 in are, sweden.  “i’m quite sad about that,” she said. “because i would for sure like to race both, and i was kind of hoping that after what i achieved last year — and after the feedback i’m getting from people where they tell me, ‘oh, you made the snowboarding sport so much more popular’ — that they might put the snowboarding event like two days earlier. but with this schedule, it’s not possible to do both.”        tom webb, u.s. ski and snowboard’s director of marketing and communications, confirmed that discussions had taken place with the international ski federation about changing the schedule to help ledecka. but webb said the conclusion was that it could not be done “without causing significant disruption” to both championships.  she might have changed the perception of her sports, but her sports are not yet ready to change for her.  “with the jetlag and everything, to do both championships i would need to be superwoman,” she said. “which i am, a little bit.”         ',\n",
       " 'minneapolis — this final four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective, if inadvertent, instances of athlete activism in college sports.  this was when the connecticut star shabazz napier, speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game, said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat.  “there are hungry nights that i go to bed and i’m starving,” he said.  within weeks, the n.c.a.a.’s board of directors for division i voted to  lift  restrictions on how much teams could feed their players. no longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal (notoriously, serving peanuts  did not count , while serving peanut butter did). now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts.  this common-sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually. but the stark comments by a high-profile player at the n.c.a.a.’s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the n.c.a.a.’s power over college athletes.        it is fruitful to remember the efficacy of napier’s comments, because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports’ much-maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within. the players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change.  what would have happened if zion williamson had said, after his nike shoe exploded, jeopardizing his career, that enough was enough, that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by nike? and that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy, either?  “the power is with labor and the players,” said kain colter, the former northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago.  this was most obviously displayed in 2015, when missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired. he stepped down. that the boycott concerned the campus’s racial climate rather than the players’ compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened: the players — unpaid, un-unionized — flexed their muscles, and the system gave in.  vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant. from jackie robinson withstanding taunts, threats and worse to break major league baseball’s color line; to baseball players striking in the 1970s and ’80s to gain and keep full-fledged free agency; to the track standout edwin moses devising benefits for olympic athletes, athletes have often been the ones bringing about change. their leverage is unmatched: they are the ones the fans pay to see, and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit.        and they are the only ones with a steady interest in, well, their own interest.  consider what else has happened since napier’s comments.  colter’s unionization effort, which a national labor relations board regional director endorsed weeks before napier’s final four, was squashed by the overall board.  the antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players.  last month, a second antitrust suit, which sought to explode the n.c.a.a.’s ban on compensation, concluded at the district-court level with a technical victory for players that  looked as much like a victory for the establishment . a federal judge ruled that the n.c.a.a. could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education.  “the courts are not a forum where you’re going to get relief,” said don yee, a sports lawyer and players-rights advocate.            image     before helping uconn beat kentucky in the championship game in 2014, shabazz napier said that he sometimes didn’t have enough to eat. that led the n.c.a.a. to lift restrictions on how much teams could feed players.   credit  ronald martinez/getty images         for yee, who also happens to be tom brady’s agent, the solution is “private entrepreneurialism.” he is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the n.f.l. (which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school). it would be developmental, like college football, but unlike college football, average pay would be $50,000.        a planned summer basketball league, the  historical basketball league , would pay scholarships for its college-level players while enabling them to sell their names, images and likenesses to sponsors. the n.b.a.’s development league plans to offer higher salaries. the probable dissolution of the one-and-done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the n.b.a. instead of having to spend at least a year in college.  a few states, notably north carolina and california, have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if, say, a video game uses their names and likenesses.  all these efforts are well intentioned. but if past is prologue, the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion.  nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition.  at a news conference in minneapolis last week, the n.c.a.a. president, mark emmert, said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports’ governance.  “i’m a lifelong academic,” he said. “i grew up with that tradition, and i never worked at a school that didn’t have students on their board, and they were full voting board members. they voted on my contract, and i think that’s just perfectly appropriate.”  there are athletes serving on several important councils, but there is  not one  on the n.c.a.a. board of governors. no athletes vote on emmert’s contract, which was extended late last year through 2023.  tim nevius, a onetime n.c.a.a. investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system, believes the answer lies with player activism. last month, he announced a new organization, the college athlete advocacy initiative, that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the n.c.a.a. with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players.        he acknowledged in an interview the challenges, including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes, as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power. but he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change.  “there are powers here that the athletes have,” he said, “and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands.”  ros gold-unwude, a turner sports analyst and former stanford basketball player, said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order.  “that’s the way our culture is, where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms,” she said.  “if you’re really struggling or hungry,” she added, “that experience will come out.”  apathy will come out as well, though. beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it, a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets.  napier, who is now a reserve on the nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article, said more during his “hungry nights” speech heard ’round the world, even though it received less publicity.  he noted that there were other wrongs. players’ jerseys were sold to fans, and the players did not receive a cut. more basically, he said, the players were not paid.  it was, he suggested, wrong. probably.  “something can change, something should change,” napier said five years ago. “but if it doesn’t, at the end of the day, we’ve been doing this for so long.”       ',\n",
       " 'london — as a teenager, michael andrew came within a second of fulfilling a dream and making the united states swim team for the 2016 olympics. now he risks missing out on the 2020 games in tokyo for altogether different reasons.  andrew, a world champion, is at the forefront of a battle being waged by some of elite swimming’s biggest names against the sport’s governing body in a fight that threatens to have repercussions beyond the pool. the dispute highlights rising tensions between athletes determined to maximize their earning potential and organizations intent on protecting guiding principles forged in the amateur era.  organizers scrapped plans for a lucrative independent meet in turin, italy, this year after fina, the international swimming federation, which is based in lausanne, switzerland, threatened competitors with bans from the sport’s biggest events, including the olympics, which remains unsurpassed in terms of profile and prestige in elite swimming. the resentment has only grown since.  andrew joined about 30 swimmers — a group that included several world and olympic champions — in london this week for two days of meetings to discuss ways to take on swimming’s power brokers. he left saying that they should be willing to be barred if it meant athletes had greater control over their destinies rather than being limited to competitions controlled by the governing body.        “if it takes them banning us for things to change, then go ahead,” he said in an interview. “yes, it’s a risk. and yes, growing up, the dream is always to have olympic gold. but if i never get an olympic gold medal, i’m fine with that. i want to be able to look back and know that i stood up for something i believe in and created a lasting change.”  andrew, who turned professional at age 14, in 2013, said his aim was to break records in the four strokes that make up the medley, his favored event. it is a feat that has never been accomplished, and now the question is whether he will undertake it at sanctioned events. currently, elite swimmers can participate only in events approved by fina.  fina appeared to cool on its threat to bar athletes from competing in unsanctioned events, releasing a statement on thursday saying only that it would not recognize times at meets outside its purview. but court battles over the issue of the federation’s control are moving forward.            image     konstantin grigorishin, a russian billionaire from ukraine, is providing the funding to create a new swimming competition.   credit  clive rose/getty images         two weeks ago, andrew joined another american swimmer, tom shields, and a hungarian one, katinka hosszu, in filing an antitrust suit in the united states district court for the northern district of california challenging fina’s control over organizing of competitions.        neil a. goteiner, who is representing the swimmers, said fina had made it clear that any swimmer who participated in the turin competition could be barred.  the suit comes on the heels of litigation last year in which speedskaters from the netherlands won a ruling from the european commission against the international skating union. the skating federation had threatened to bar the speedskaters if they participated in an unsanctioned event. in soccer, fifa, seeking gain leverage over the elite clubs that had started discussions about the possibility of a new breakaway competition, recently warned players that they could be barred from the world cup.  athletes in track and field and tennis won similar battles with their international federations in the 1970s and 1980s, but not without some pain. in 1973, 81 of the world’s top tennis players walked out of wimbledon after the tournament honored the international tennis federation’s suspension of niki pilic, of the former yugoslavia, who had opted to play a commercial tournament earlier in the year instead of representing his country in the i.t.f.-controlled davis cup. after the walkout, the i.t.f. never again challenged the players’ rights to set their own schedules.  the swimmers’ suit is being funded by konstantin grigorishin, a russian billionaire from ukraine who is a leading shareholder in the energy standard group, an engineering and utility conglomerate. he is also the founder of the international swimming league, a series that he says will revolutionize the sport, which has long existed under the radar between olympics.  the league will offer higher prize money to athletes who, outside of an elite few, rarely earn enough to sustain a career. the league aims to attract broad interest in swimming every year. the company filed its own suit in california against fina, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior.  “the world is changing, and i think it’s unavoidable for sports governing bodies to accept this,” grigorishin said.        discussions for a league featuring 12 teams, split between europe and north america, and culminating in a final meet at the mandalay bay resort in las vegas will continue in january, he said.            image        the president of the international swimming federation, fina, julio c. maglione, is battling to maintain his federation’s control of the sport.   credit  zsolt szigetvary/mti via ap         fina has been scrambling in the face of the challenge. it announced its own champions swim series, a new team event with almost $4 million in prize money.  fina has said it will mount “a robust” defense against the legal challenges. the governing body will make it clear that competitions outside its auspices create what it has called integrity issues. the federation argues that its presence is required to ensure proper drug testing and certified timing standards, for example.  the crisis has shined a spotlight on fina’s governance. julio maglione, an international olympic committee member from uruguay, is in his 80s and has run the organization for a decade. his most senior vice president is husain al-musallam, a kuwaiti official who was identified last year as an unindicted co-conspirator in a united states department of justice sports corruption case. he has denied any wrongdoing.  in july, the organization moved into plush new headquarters in lausanne. adam peaty, an olympic gold medalist who holds two breaststroke world records, accused swimming’s leaders of being more preoccupied with their privileged lifestyles than with developing the sport. he joined andrew in saying he was prepared to be barred to compete in commercial events. he said many top swimmers were forced to do other work to finance their careers.  “why do fina spend millions on a headquarters and an athlete has to have a second job?” he said.  peaty, who rose to stardom in britain thanks to gold medal success at the rio olympics, added that his six-figure income was well below what athletes of a similar standard in other sports could earn. “i’ve got bills to pay,” he said. “i’ve got a family to sustain in the future.”  the international swimming league has pledged to split its take from its prospective competition with the athletes, promising appearance fees and prize money to participants. there have yet to be meaningful contacts with broadcast or sponsorship partners.        grigorishin, like many others who have profited from the collapse of the former soviet union, has a colorful business history and a career littered with legal battles. he was arrested in early 2002 by the ukrainian authorities for possession of drugs and a firearm but later cleared his name. he said the charges had been fabricated by “some dirty businessmen trying to get some part of my business.”  after years of planning, he said, he was willing to spend $7 million on legal fees to begin the swimming league.  while organizing the league remains a work in progress, he has pledged as much as $19 million for events next year. that has won over several stars of the sport. ryan murphy, an american who has won three olympic golds, and federica pellegrini, an italian who has won one, also attended wednesday’s meetings in london.

       " 'miami gardens, fla. — at 40, bob bryan can dive for volleys again. he can turn, twist and slap fast-twitch returns. he can also win more titles: he partnered with his twin brother, mike, and triumphed at the delray beach open and the miami open in the last six weeks.  it is all beginning to feel so familiar that bob bryan, one of the greatest doubles players in history, often forgets that he now has a mostly metal right hip.  “when i take the towel off, and i walk by a mirror, i go: ‘whoa! look at that scar!’” he said. “i have a 10-inch scar, and without that scar, i wouldn’t even know it’s in there.”  tennis has long produced first-rate comeback tales. it has been 30 years since thomas muster, the intense austrian, whacked groundstrokes  in a custom-designed chair  designed to protect his postoperative left knee, which was injured when a drunken driver plowed into muster’s parked vehicle at the tournament in key biscayne, fla.        muster returned to the tour and reached no. 1.  bryan’s renaissance at an age when most tennis stars have long since retired is certainly one for the short list, too.  it has been less than a year since he was hobbling down the boardwalk in santa cruz, calif., with his wife, michelle, certain that his remarkable career was over. he was concerned, above all, about getting healthy enough to play with his three young children.  “i couldn’t walk for more than five minutes,” he said.  the orthopedic surgeon edwin su resurfaced bryan’s hip on aug. 2 at the hospital for special surgery in new york and explained that, if all went very well, bryan could envision returning to tournament play eight months later.  he returned to action in five months and, now at the eight-month mark, is winning significant tournaments.  “what bob is doing is incredible,” su said in a telephone interview on monday. “he really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implant.”        “incredible” is quite a word choice from a surgeon who has performed more than 4,000 such procedures. a few others were on professional athletes trying to save their careers, including the former major league pitcher colby lewis.  but no professional tennis player has had this procedure and returned to the fore, although andy murray, who underwent the same type of operation in january in london after plenty of chatting and texting with bryan, may try to do the same.          “the things that make bob bryan great, you don’t know if you are going to lose that with an artificial joint and surgery,” su said. “it’s amazing to see he doesn’t seem to have lost any of it and in fact is now able to play without pain.”  david macpherson, the bryans’ longtime coach, said bob was playing like the “30-year-old bob.”  “he’s exploding to poaches like the old days when he would just steal points from incredible cross-court returns by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking off balls,” macpherson said in miami. “i also feel he’s a little more confident on the return, letting it go and doing more damage than before, and he is still serving just as nasty. so i really feel he’s in a great place right now, where he’s just enjoying his life and loves his family but is getting a second lease on tennis.”  after bob’s hip problem became acute in madrid last may, mike went on to win  wimbledon  and the  united states open  with jack sock. bob attended their practices in new york while using a cane. but there was no doubt the twins would reunite on court if bob could recover.  “with all the success mike was having with jack in the majors, bob just handled it all with so much class and was so supportive of mike in that time,” macpherson said.        doubles has been deeply overshadowed in the modern era, with the biggest stars like roger federer and rafael nadal focusing on singles in grand slam tournaments. but in a parched environment, the bryans — mike the right-hander, and bob the lefty — have managed to carve out a rich niche with their winning ways and personalities.  they have enthusiastically gone above and beyond to sign just about every autograph and pose for just about every selfie, but bob is reaching a new audience now.  “i talk to probably three or four people a week, people who get my number and call me about hip problems,” he said. “a professional soccer player in australia. i’m getting hit up by people all the time.”  he said he had spoken with murray, the former world no. 1 from britain, most recently about a week ago.  “he was asking me a lot of questions in the early weeks, because obviously those are the weeks where you are not feeling great and probably a little concerned,” bryan said. “but i think he’s probably feeling really good right now.”  murray has posted video of himself on social media lightly hitting tennis balls. but returning in singles, with full-court coverage required, is a more daunting prospect.  “i think a three-out-of-five-set singles match is almost close to 50 times more physical than doubles,” bryan said. “it’s going to really challenge andy, the movement. but i can jump. i can lunge, and i am not sore after matches.”        as murray debated whether to have surgery, bryan put him in touch with su, who said murray was an ideal candidate for the procedure. murray ultimately chose to have it done closer to home by sarah muirhead-allwood, a leading british hip surgeon..  can he come back and play singles at the highest level?  “i think he would be able to,” su said.  hip resurfacing is not a total hip replacement. it calls for shaving a thin layer of damaged bone off the ball of the hip joint and replacing it with a metal cap — “like crowning a tooth,” su said.  a metal socket is also put in place. “when bob refers to it as his metal hip, it is truly metal,” su said.  bryan credited su, an avid tennis player, for his success so far.  “people tell me this surgery comes down to millimeters,” bryan said. “i’ve talked to people who had different doctors and have done the same procedure, and they feel like crap.”  su said he believed bryan’s recovery had been accelerated in part by the use of a relatively new rehabilitation tool: an  anti-gravity treadmill , which supports a player at the hips with an inflatable lower-body compartment and reduces the risks of fractures in the recovery phase.  “you can un-weight the body to 60 percent to 70 or 80,” su said.  su saw bryan compete in the bnp paribas open in indian wells, calif., last month.  “i love it, just to see what he’s able to do,” su said. “i cringe a little bit when he dives, but he’s done it several times, and no worse for the wear.”        will such acrobatics and the other rigors of professional tennis put bryan at greater risk of requiring follow-up surgery down the road?  “that’s a really good question we don’t have the answer to,” su said. “we don’t have enough data in terms of how it would hold up to activity such as this. this has been done now for almost two decades, so there are some very active patients out there, and activity doesn’t seem to make it wear out. we’re drawing from the experiences of recreational athletes.”  the miami title was the bryans’ 118th together on tour. they had once planned on retiring after the 2012 olympics and were close to retirement at the 2017 australian open. but such plans are on hold, even with their 41st birthday looming on april 29.  “now we’re looking at tokyo in 2020,” bob said of the next olympics, while emphasizing that “we never wanted to play until we were 45 or 46.”  skepticism is definitely permitted at this stage.  “i know,” bob said with a chuckle. “my wife doesn’t believe me, either.”       ',\n",
       " 'montreal — the world anti-doping association’s compliance review committee will meet in montreal, the organization’s home city, on monday and tuesday to discuss a problem that will not go away — russia’s antidoping laboratories, and what to do about the country missing a key end-of-year deadline.  no matter what the committee recommends, and the possibilities range from competition bans to mere slaps on the wrist to nothing, the long-running story of russia’s antidoping laboratories is bound to continue.  hanging in the balance is the credibility of the world’s foremost antidoping watchdog, which has endured withering criticism from athletes in recent months who say the organization has allowed a rogue nation to run roughshod over its attempts at enforcement.  in an open letter last week to jonathan taylor, the chairman of the compliance review committee, the swedish biathlete sebastian samuelsson wrote, “given that this doping crisis involving russia is the biggest in history, and the fact that many athletes have so shamefully been cheated out of podium positions not to mention financial rewards by the state-sponsored doping system, this issue requires proper leadership and good, honest communication — two things that have been very neglected by the current wada leadership.”        wada leaders have said they remain committed to clean sport and holding russia to account.  roughly four years after russia’s corruption of the drug-testing process first came to light, wada’s executive committee voted 9 to 2 in september to allow  russia to resume testing its own athletes  for performance-enhancing drugs, even though it had not fulfilled every requirement of a compliance agreement.  russia’s drug-testing agency had been banned since 2015, after a vast state-sponsored doping scheme was uncovered. while 160 russian athletes were cleared to compete in the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, they competed under the banner of olympic athletes from russia, and russia remains a controversial member of the international sports world. in 2016, russian athletes had to receive special permission from the international federations governing their sports to compete at the rio games.  individual federations have handled the situation differently. some, like the international association of athletics federations, which oversees track and field, have barred all russian athletes from competing since 2015. others, like soccer’s governing body, fifa, have  allowed them to compete .  the reinstatement of the russian anti-doping agency’s laboratories came with a number of conditions attached, all of which russia agreed to. the most significant condition compelled russia to hand over data from its corrupted antidoping laboratories by the end of the year. numerous wada teams sent to russia were rebuffed, and russia  missed the deadline .  last week, a three-person wada team in moscow was finally  allowed into the laboratory to begin collecting data . the computer data sought by wada investigators had been sealed off by russian law enforcement, leading to the bizarre circumstance of the russian anti-doping agency urging the russian government to cooperate with wada on an investigation of the russian anti-doping agency’s own laboratories.        it was unclear whether the work would be completed before the compliance review committee began meeting at wada’s headquarters on monday, or if russian law enforcement would impose any more hurdles. but even if the work is completed, it is highly unlikely that wada officials will quickly be able to certify that the data is complete and authentic, and some skeptics will not trust the data no matter what because russia missed the deadline.            image     sebastian samuelsson of sweden has become an outspoken critic of wada.   credit  robert michael/agence france-presse — getty images         “on monday, i will be asking, ‘have we got the data?’ and if the answer is no, it will be a short discussion,” said taylor, a lawyer based in london. his implication was that if the data was incomplete, the committee would have no choice but to recommend russia be declared noncompliant.  if that happens, the future participation of russian athletes in international competitions will once again be in doubt, a situation that major sports organizations like the international olympic committee are desperate to avoid.  a number of sporting figures have called for russia to be declared noncompliant for missing the deadline. most prominently, wada’s own athlete committee  has said  it expects russia to be declared noncompliant, and that anything less “will be considered a failure by wada to act on behalf of clean athletes.”  travis tygart, the head of the united states anti-doping agency and a vocal critic of how wada has handled russia, sounded a cautious note on friday.  “of course, if accurate, it is a good thing that the signals emerging from wada are that its group has been allowed into the moscow laboratory,” he said in a statement. but in the meantime, he believes russia should be declared noncompliant.        even if wada obtains all the data, managing the process remains complicated. “the question will be how do we move forward, what do we do about the fact that they are late, what do we do about the fact that we don’t know yet that the data are authentic,” taylor said.  the committee will make a recommendation and send it to wada’s executive committee, which is expected to meet later in january.  the executive committee, which generally follows the recommendations of the compliance review committee, can choose to do nothing, and allow russia’s reinstatement to remain. if it decides to once again seek the suspension of russia’s antidoping laboratories, it will send a letter asserting noncompliance laying out a set of recommended consequences. russia would then have 21 days to decide whether to agree, or to challenge the noncompliance in front of the court of arbitration for sport.  if wada declines to seek noncompliance, the next deadline is june 30. by then, russia must submit any stored athlete samples that, based on the data, wada wishes to examine.  the data wada seeks consists of about 10,000 suspicious doping samples. assuming wada finds that a number of them contain evidence of doping, it will be up to the dozens of individual sports federations to bring cases and charge the athletes.  in other words, whether russia is declared noncompliant or not, the continuing fallout from the country’s doping scheme is likely to stretch deep into 2019, especially with the world track and field championships set for september in doha, qatar.

       " 'wabasha, minn. — in the weeks before the olympic cyclist kelly catlin killed herself, she felt her mind slipping.  she could not focus on her schoolwork at stanford, where she was a first-year graduate student in computational mathematics. in an email she sent to her family, a coach and a friend in january, she said her thoughts were “never-ending spinning, spinning, spinning” as if they were “never at rest, never at peace.”  she wrote that she cried about it, and that made her feel even worse. for years, catlin, 23, was someone who took pride in holding back tears.  catlin told her sister, christine, that seeking therapy meant she was weak and that she would rather suffer. she told her brother, colin, that she thought she was going insane and she worried that she was a danger to others because she was filled with rage.        she wrote that she was scared of dying.  “what is it like to no longer have a mind?” she wrote in january, just days before a first suicide attempt. she answered the question.  “it is unimaginable,” she wrote. “terrifying.”  catlin was poised for stardom at the 2020 olympics in tokyo, where she had a reasonable shot for olympic gold that eluded her in 2016. with the advanced degree from stanford she was working toward, she could have her pick of jobs in computers.  how, those who knew her are asking now, could she find no purpose to keep living? how could she be so unknown to the people closest to her?  kelly catlin had sought to explain herself and her distress, both over the phone and in notes before she was found dead in her stanford apartment on march 8. in one note she wrote in january, she even asked, “what do you wish to know?”, leaving a trail of cryptic answers.            image     kelly catlin’s brother, colin, sifts through the belongings retrieved from her graduate student apartment at stanford, hoping for clues explaining why she took her life last month at age 23.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         “you think you know your children,” her mother, carolyn emory, said, “but there was so much about kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end. she was very private.”        on friday, a month after she killed herself, a white van showed up at her parents’ farmhouse to drop off her things.  three bikes. nearly a dozen boxes of clothes, books and cycling gear. her carbon-fiber violin. duffel bags stuffed with cycling gear and united states olympic team uniforms from the 2016 rio games, where she won a silver medal.  her mother and her brother, colin catlin, sifted through the belongings, retrieved from her apartment. her father, dr. mark catlin, could only join them in spurts because he was so distraught.  every item provoked a memory, none a clue.  colin catlin had hoped to find telling information on her phone, but instead he found the wallpaper she selected for it haunting: an album cover featuring a body with daggers in its back. the album title was “try to die.”  he broke into tears.  it was hard to absorb that just months before, in november, on the podium at a world cup track cycling race, where catlin’s squad finished second in the team pursuit, she soaked in the moment: flags waving, fans cheering, adrenaline pumping. a three-time world champion, catlin considered the victory a prelude to finally winning an olympic gold medal.  off the track, she was fulfilling a lifelong obsession with numbers and order through her academics and planning for a career in silicon valley.        this solid trajectory she appeared to be on had made her mental downward spiral and death all the more mystifying to teammates, friends and family members.  catlin’s father, who is a pathologist, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries from a january suicide attempt about a month before she was found dead in her dorm. on both occasions, she inhaled noxious gas.            image        kelly catlin, second from the left, and her teammates celebrate a silver medal in the women’s team pursuit at the 2016 rio olympic games.   credit  bryn lennon/getty images         but the breaking point, he and other family members believe, was a concussion she sustained during a training ride on jan. 5. they have donated her brain to researchers to find out if the head injury contributed to her behavior changes.  regardless of the results, nothing can give the family a definitive answer. suicide is much more complicated than lab results can reveal and multiple factors, like destabilizing life events, brain chemistry and persistent mental struggles, almost always come into play.  “i wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,” said her father, whose eyes were reddened by weeks of crying. “i can’t help but wonder what she would’ve done with her life.”  kelly’s mother answered, weeping, “something great.”  ‘never love’  catlin and her triplet siblings, christine and colin, grew up in arden hills, minn., a suburb of minneapolis. her parents — her mother is a former alzheimer’s researcher — met in a lab dissecting brains.        the catlins lived in a large house with an indoor gymnasium. they took european vacations and roasted s’mores in the backyard. they were a family of introverts who enjoyed staying at home for tea parties. for kelly, christine and colin, school and sports were equally important. they excelled at both.  kelly was the super-focused athlete, a first-chair violinist who studied nonstop. christine was the creative writer and runner who played three instruments. colin was the math whiz who played guitar and rode bikes competitively. in middle school, the siblings tied for most likely to succeed.  “our parents always told us that we could be great at anything we wanted to, if we worked hard enough,” christine said. “looking back, maybe we kind of twisted that into thinking we weren’t worth anything if we weren’t the best. i think kelly believed that.”  kelly’s parents said she was an intense child who grew socially awkward with age. in elementary school, when she could not figure out addition or subtraction, she would scream for hours in frustration, they said, and refused to take a break.  for years in her youth, she was obsessed with horses. she studied the 512-page book “the ultimate book of the horse and rider” so much that she had to tape the binding because the book was so worn. she maintained a collection of dozens of model horses that she did not allow anyone to touch because they were arranged in a certain order.            image        “you think you know your children, but there was so much about kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end,” catlin’s mother, carolyn emory, said.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         christine catlin described her sister as a once outgoing, friendly girl who began closing herself off in middle school because she was “so obsessed with success.”        kelly catlin also began to limit her social interactions to “robotic social motions,” as catlin herself put it in the january note to family and friends. around third grade, catlin established her lifelong code to live by and included some of it in the note, which was shared with the new york times:   fear not physical discomfort. never love. never engage in a relationship that could be defined as having a significant other. (in my case, a so-called “boyfriend.”) never allow yourself to become close enough to another that their actions or inactions might cause you (any amount of) distress or pain. if kindness and gentleness are at all an option, they are the only option.    “we all knew that she didn’t like to express her emotions,” christine catlin said. “she never really told anyone how she ever felt, until the very end, that is.”  cycling calls  colin and christine catlin were cycling for a local development team, northstar, when kelly quit high school soccer and joined them, at colin’s prodding. she loved long training rides and used cycling as a way to practice memorization, another passion.  she would remember dozens of license plates of cars passing her and would recite the number pi to hundreds of decimals, colin catlin said. she mapped out training routes in her head.  “she liked that cycling kept her mind focused, but i think she liked it most when she started winning everything,” said colin, a data scientist. “her mentality was, if you wanted to be an olympian, all you had to do was train hard.”  and kelly did make it seem easy. within two years of starting to race, she was invited to the united states olympic training center in colorado, where coaches put cyclists through testing to see if they are national team material. kelly was that, and more.  her power output on the stationary bike was higher than every other recruit and higher than several athletes on the national track cycling team, said neal henderson, one of the coaches back then.        track cyclists compete on a banked oval, called a velodrome, and catlin seemed suited for it because it required both power and precision.            image        kelly catlin, second from left, with jennifer valente, chloe dygert and kimberly geist, during the women&rsquo;s team pursuit final at the world championships in march 2018. the u.s. team won the gold medal.   credit  peter dejong/associated press         she was drawn to the science of cycling. she wasn’t comfortable with the social aspect of it. in the notes she wrote in her final weeks, she acknowledged not having many friends.  “it’s not that she didn’t want friends,” her brother said. “it was just a matter of priorities. and her priority was to be successful and respected.”  like her siblings, catlin could not stand to be hugged, family members said. she would rather bury herself in a book than chat with peers. she had a playful sense of humor — often dark humor — within her family circle, but rarely showed it to outsiders.  although she exuded confidence, she described in a note having a “phenomenally powerful fear of social embarrassment,” and also long worried that she would not be able to keep up with other cyclists, said charlie and sherry townsend, the co-founders of her development team. it was a classic impostor syndrome, they said.  “but she changed because of cycling, she really did,” said sherry townsend, a psychologist, adding that catlin’s self-esteem rose after she competed in the olympics. “she was slowly learning how to be better engaged with people, slowly learning how to share her thoughts with others. but it was still hard to really know her.”        catlin’s nickname at the olympic training center, where she lived before the 2016 olympics, was roy orbison, because she always wore dark glasses. she wore her hair short because it was practical for the sport, so short that she was sometimes mistaken for a young man.  chloé dygert, an olympic teammate, said she was thrilled when catlin started to open up, even occasionally agreeing to a quick hug. dygert and a teammate once convinced catlin to play the violin for them.  “it was, like, whoa, so good that it was jaw-dropping,” dygert said. “kelly was just amazing. she read a book every day, even while brushing her teeth, and it was hard to keep up. she was a lovely girl on the inside.”  a concussion, then changes  the concussion that her family said changed everything happened on jan. 5 when catlin crashed while riding with her professional road cycling team, rally uhc cycling. a team spokesman said there was “no indication that she hit her head or had a serious injury” when the team evaluated her.            image        catlin’s father, dr. mark catlin, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         but at a national team training camp two days later, catlin felt dizzy and could not continue working out. she told the team about her crash. medical personnel at the olympic training center placed her on concussion protocol and suggested rest, said guillermo rojas, a spokesman for usa cycling.  yet catlin continued to complain to her parents of headaches, sensitivity to light and trouble sleeping. and this was coming months after a fall in october that left her with a broken arm and weakened interest in the national team.        “there was this profound apathy,” her father said. “she didn’t care about winning medals anymore.”  life at stanford was much different than she was used to. she moved into a dorm there after living with her brother at the university of minnesota while finishing her undergraduate degree. colin had cooked her meals and often had to trick her into taking breaks from studying and training, playing episodes of the television show “stargate” because she could not resist science fiction.  at stanford, she spent a lot of time alone because her roommate, a law student, was often not there.  after the concussion, catlin simply could not focus anymore on school or cycling — or anything. in late january, she wrote that she had started planning her suicide before her crash and concussion. but her family thinks that was not true.  “for the first time in her life, miss stoical couldn’t force herself to go on,” her father said, choking up. “this is when she began planning her suicide.”  after her first suicide attempt, catlin spent about a week in a hospital psychiatric ward. when she left that treatment, she began attending group therapy sessions, which she deemed useless, her parents said, and she said she could not find an available psychiatrist who met her needs.  when catlin moved back into her on-campus apartment, her parents flew home to minnesota to give her space, telling her, “we love you, we want you alive,” her father said. they banked on her assurances that she wouldn’t try to kill herself again. she had given her word, a part of her personal code they knew.  “she fooled us all,” her mother said.  the suicide attempt and concussion had damaged her brain and heart, her family said, so competing at the world championships on feb. 27 was not possible. the day the championships began, catlin wrote a blog post in which she described managing her cycling career with her graduate studies as “juggling with knives” and said, “i really am dropping a lot of them.” in a note she wrote in march, she said, “if i am not an athlete, i am nothing.”            image        kelly catlin’s grave at lakewood cemetery in minneapolis.   credit  jenn ackerman for the new york times         looking back, her father said, it was clear she needed time for her brain to heal, but it appeared nobody could impress that on her.  he said her lifelong resolve played a big factor in trying to kill herself again.  “she was furious that she survived her first suicide attempt,” her father said.  a last call  christine catlin’s phone rang in late february, and it was kelly. they had not spoken at length in years because they were busy with their own lives after high school, but now kelly wanted to talk. christine found it strange. it was nothing kelly would have done before her concussion.  kelly said she worried that the physical effects of her concussion or her first suicide attempt — or both — were affecting her judgment.  she asked: what could christine see her doing in the future?  the sister answered: you could do public speaking about suicide awareness and help people. or you could do remote computer programming so you don’t have to be around people. you could own a farm and be around horses all day.  “you could bike, if you want to,” christine said. “or not.”  kelly seemed to feel better after the call, which lasted two and a half hours.        still, she told christine, “if things don’t change in a month, i’m probably going to kill myself.”  christine begged kelly not to do it.  “o.k.,” kelly said, with a tone christine now realizes was less than convincing.  the call was over. christine rushed to call her parents, and for days afterward the family repeatedly checked on kelly. two weeks after that conversation, catlin’s life was over.  at a memorial service in minneapolis on march 23, kelly catlin was dressed in the uniform the united states team wore for the rio games opening ceremony, and the majority of her pallbearers were her cycling teammates. she was buried at the foot of a 50-foot oak tree at lakewood cemetery, near one of her favorite bike paths.  before the coffin was closed, her sister, christine, slipped in a handwritten note that included these words:   kelly, if i could trade my life for yours, i would. i love you without all your accomplishments.    ——————————————————————————————————    if you are having thoughts of suicide, call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 800-273-8255 (talk) or go to

       " 'robin and david kowalski barely recognized their daughter bailey when she was visiting home in white lake, mich., in the spring of 2015.  their perennially positive daughter, who was about to finish her freshman year at michigan state, was sullen. she had suddenly decided to abandon her long-held dream of being a sports journalist, and she refused to tell her mother, in whom she typically confided everything, why.  it was not until october, after months of erratic behavior, that ms. kowalski told her parents that she had been raped by three michigan state basketball players that april. the incident left her depressed and considering harming herself. she dropped out of college for a while and received counseling. she gave up sports journalism for good.  last year, ms. kowalski, 22, who is speaking publicly about her case for the first time, sued michigan state in federal court for violating her rights under title ix, the federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, as a jane doe. the lawsuit asserts that michigan state mishandles sexual misconduct complaints against athletes. one woman said two football players raped her in 2009, but she was not advised of her title ix rights, the lawsuit said, and another woman said three basketball players raped her in 2010, after which the accusations were not reported outside the athletic department.        a michigan state motion to dismiss the case is pending. a university spokeswoman, emily guerrant, declined to comment on the case while the litigation is ongoing but said michigan state “is dedicated to making sure every student receives fair treatment and support when they need it.”  ms. kowalski has decided to come forward, hoping she can persuade other victims, at michigan state or elsewhere, to tell their stories.  according to ms. kowalski, when a university counselor learned that the men who she said assailed her were members of the basketball team — a storied and treasured program that has played in 10 final fours, including this year’s — the counselor discouraged her from reporting it, the lawsuit said.  “if you pursue this, you are going to be swimming with some really big fish,” a staff member told ms. kowalski, the lawsuit said.  ms. kowalski plans to hold a news conference in east lansing on thursday, the fourth anniversary of the incident. a month later, she will graduate from michigan state.        “i don’t want any other girl who has gone through this or who god forbid may have to go through something like this to feel for one second that they should be too afraid to come out and do something,” ms. kowalski said in a phone interview last week.  her lawyer, karen truszkowski, said that a separate title ix investigation initiated by the university last june had dragged on.  “it will not be resolved within a year,” said ms. truszkowski, who declined to discuss the substance of the investigation because it is pending. “that has consumed her entire senior year.”  ms. kowalski is still declining to name the men she says raped her on the night of april 11, 2015. all were members of the 2014-15 spartans team, she said. she has not filed a police report, but is considering doing so.  it’s still unclear to ms. kowalski who at michigan state eventually learned about what she told the counselor. “i still to this day don’t know who knew,” she said. “how far up. who was the last person to know about what i told the counselor in the counseling center the day i went in?”            image     a federal lawsuit asserts that michigan state mishandled sexual misconduct complaints against athletes.   credit  brittany greeson for the new york times         more than a year ago, michigan state’s president and athletic director resigned after the depredations of lawrence g. nassar, the former university doctor who has been accused of sexual abuse by hundreds of women, including olympic gymnasts, and convicted of sex crimes, became a source of national outrage.        also last winter, espn  reported  several previously undisclosed sexual misconduct allegations against members of michigan state’s football and men’s basketball programs. in several instances, espn said, the accusations were handled by the athletics program, rather than the venues mandated by federal law.  “there’s a lot that they have yet to take accountability for, as far as what’s going on in the athletic department and the systematic errors that are allowing the athletic department to be put above females that have been victims of sexual assault by athletes,” ms. kowalski said.  the lawsuit states that the sexual assault occurred in april 2015 after an informal celebration at an east lansing bar for the basketball team, which had recently returned from the final four in indianapolis, where it lost to the eventual champion, duke, in the national semifinals. (ms. kowalski, days away from turning 19, said she used fake identification to enter the bar.)  ms. kowalski’s roommate encouraged her to approach the players.  “i knew their stats, numbers, everything,” ms. kowalski said, adding, “she knew how i looked up to those guys.”  a team member invited ms. kowalski to his place for a party, and she accepted a drive to an off-campus apartment, the lawsuit said. when she arrived, there was no one else there, and ms. kowalski, who had already had trouble holding her glass at the bar despite not drinking much, had trouble controlling her thumbs to send a text, the lawsuit said.  the three players took turns raping her, the lawsuit said. she woke up later in the apartment and took a taxi back to her dorm.  ms. kowalski visited the michigan state university counseling center roughly a week later, she said. the counselor she met with appeared to change her response to ms. kowalski upon learning that the men she said had attacked her were members of the basketball team. the counselor immediately insisted on having a second person in the room, the lawsuit said. ms. kowalski was not advised to seek a physical exam or pregnancy or s.t.d. testing, and was not made aware of her rights under title ix.        with cases with “guys with big names,” she was told, according to the lawsuit, the best thing was to “just get yourself better.”  “she lived with that thought of, ‘just get yourself better,’” said her mother, robin kowalski, in a phone interview last week.  when bailey kowalski first sued michigan state last spring, the university rebutted her claims in a statement with significant and unusual detail. “we have not found any evidence or indication that she was discouraged in any way to make a title ix complaint or a complaint to the police department,” it said. it also said that the university police eventually contacted her.  a day later, michigan state’s former interim president, john engler, said in a statement, “we regret that we provided an unnecessary amount of detail” in the initial response.  “they went out to the press and essentially addressed my lawsuit as a lie,” ms. kowalski said, “which basically was a message to anyone else coming forward with allegations similar to mine that, ‘if you’re going to do that, we’re going to completely exploit you.’”  after taking much of a semester off and receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment, ms. kowalski elected to return to michigan state, believing that transferring to an unknown campus where she did not know anyone would have been worse. her brother is currently a sophomore at michigan state.  she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, she said, and felt she could never return to the vocation to which she had long aspired. she switched from a planned double-major in journalism and spanish to one in biology. she hopes eventually to become a veterinarian.

       " 'the global regulator of drugs in sports on thursday voted to allow russia to resume testing its athletes for performance-enhancing drugs, despite an outcry from athletes and watchdogs that moscow has not done enough to clean up its record of corruption in competitions.  russia, whose drug-testing agency has been banned for three years, will now be able to certify on its own that its athletes are not using illicit drugs, allowing them easier entry to a range of competitions. russia will also be able to issue what are known as therapeutic use exemptions, which permit athletes to use certain prohibited drugs for medical reasons.  the executive board of the world anti-doping agency made the move despite a series of independent investigations that found russia had orchestrated a vast, state-sponsored doping scheme that tainted the olympics and other major sports events.  it comes at a time of mounting skepticism about the fairness of international sports competitions as the use of performance-enhancing drugs remains pervasive. athletes say they do not have faith that their competitors are not doping. they also say the governing bodies of their sports have failed to ensure the integrity of the competition, even at the highest-profile events, like the olympics.        the decision clears russia to start hosting international sports events again. in addition, it paves the way for russian athletes to begin competing under their own flag in every sport. russia’s track and field athletes might be welcomed back at all international events; the i.a.a.f., track and field’s world governing body, had refused to accept russian athletes while the country’s antidoping agency was not considered in compliance with wada standards.  minutes after russia was cleared by wada, the organizers of the european games, a multisport event, named kazan, russia, to a shortlist of three cities to host the event in 2023.  the vote by wada’s board was 9 to 2, with one abstention, to reinstate russia’s antidoping agency, which had been banned since 2015 after investigators found it was at the center of  the doping conspiracy at the 2014 winter games in sochi, russia .  the conspiracy included, among other methods, substituting clean urine for tainted samples through a hidden hole in the wall at the agency’s testing laboratory in sochi. the lab was guarded by members of russia’s state security services, according to the investigations.  the doping conspiracy led the international olympic committee to ban russia from the winter olympics this year in pyeongchang, south korea.        nearly 170 russian athletes ultimately participated through special dispensations from the international sports federations. but russia’s national olympic committee was prohibited from attending. the russian flag was not officially displayed and the athletes had to wear neutral uniforms with “olympic athlete from russia” printed on them.  after the games, russia continued to deny the state had sponsored the doping and it declined to give investigators access to its testing labs and possibly tainted urine samples. russia, in an agreement with wada, was supposed to admit to the doping scheme and turn over data and samples before the agency reinstated it.  after negotiations between russian officials and leaders of international sports organizations, however, a wada committee unexpectedly recommended the reinstatement last friday. the full board, meeting in the seychelles, affirmed it.  the organization backed off insisting that russia accept the findings of an investigation by richard mclaren that laid out evidence of a state-supported doping program in sochi. instead, wada asked russia to accept the less harsh findings on the government’s role in what is known as the schmid report, produced by an international olympic committee commission.  pavel kolobkov, russia’s sports minister, said in a letter to wada that his government accepted the findings of the schmid report and agreed to turn over data and stored samples from russian athletes.  wada’s president, craig reedie, said that the reinstatement came with “strict conditions” and that russia could be ruled noncompliant again if it failed to follow a timeline for allowing access to russian data and samples before dec. 31. that data is crucial for adjudicating hundreds of possible cases of cheating from years ago.            the decision brought renewed criticism of wada, which had angered athletes and other antidoping officials by softening some of the demands it made of russia.  travis tygart, chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency, called the decision “a devastating blow to the world’s clean athletes.”  mr. tygart and other antidoping leaders and athletes critical of the decision said going back on the so-called “road map” for russia’s reinstatement was akin to putting the desires of sports officials and a powerful nation above the rights of clean athletes.  he vowed to use the decision to build momentum for a significant reformation of wada so the organization does not include representatives from sports organizations. the world’s athletes “want a wada with teeth, authority, sanctioning power and the determination to get the job done of cleaning up sport and restoring the trust of the billions of sports fans and athletes worldwide.”  richard pound, the i.o.c. member who was the first president of wada and who conducted an initial report on russian doping in 2015, defended the deal as the only way to guarantee access to all the information necessary to pursue cases of cheating. the original requirements for reinstatement did not explicitly state that the russians must provide the computer records of each athlete’s cheating, but the latest ones do. in exchange for that, wada essentially dropped its demand that russia admit to state-sponsored doping.  “when you’re dealing with issues diplomatically, sometimes you can’t go at them directly,” mr. pound said. “sometimes by circling you get at it.”        mr. tygart and wada’s other critics have long complained that the organization includes too many leaders of sports organizations with conflicted loyalties in positions of power. six members of wada’s 12-person executive committee have positions with an international or national sports organization.  linda hofstad helleland of norway, who voted against reinstatement, said the vote “casts a dark shadow over the credibility of the antidoping movement.”  max cobb, a member of the international biathlon union’s executive board, said wada needed to get access to the lab data as quickly as possible. “i want to see these cases adjudicated,” mr. cobb said.  mr. reedie told the bbc before the vote on thursday: “i think it’s entirely within the road map that was specified. the second condition still requires a copy of the database and raw data to come to us. if they don’t deliver, they won’t be compliant.”  but many athletes and officials expressed dismay.  beckie scott, a former cross-country skier from canada who resigned from the wada compliance review committee after it endorsed readmitting the russian antidoping authorities, said after the decision on thursday that she was “profoundly disappointed.”  in a statement on thursday, the i.a.a.f. said it had its own set of criteria for reinstating russia. rune andersen, an antidoping expert from norway who has been leading the track federation’s task force on russia, will review wada’s decision and make a recommendation to the i.a.a.f in december. but the federation suggested that it might continue to take a hard line on russia and insist that russia admit to state-sponsored doping.  “the setting of our own criteria and the process of evaluating progress against these criteria has served the sport of athletics well over the last three years, so we will continue to rely on the task force and our clear road map,” said sebastian coe, the olympic champion who is the president of the i.a.a.f.        in a statement, u.k. sport, the united kingdom’s government agency charged with the development of elite athletes, said it was disappointed in the decision: “we call on wada to fully and transparently explain how it came to the compromise of reinstating russia — and how it will ensure that the new conditions are fully met and implemented. a strong wada and a unified antidoping community are vital to the integrity of sport and to ensure public trust and support is maintained.”  ahead of the decision, in  an opinion article in the new york times , edwin moses, the former hurdling star and chairman of the united states anti-doping agency, said, “having spoken to athletes, i know they overwhelmingly support the right decision being made in the seychelles — they overwhelmingly support wada’s sticking to its road map.”  dr. grigory rodchenkov, the whistle-blower who revealed russia’s doping program, urged against the decision in  an opinion article  published by usa today. “wada must not fall prey to manipulation and false assertions from the ministry, the same arm of the kremlin that facilitated the doping program and asserted false compliance,” dr. rodchenkov wrote. “to do so would be nothing short of a catastrophe for clean sport.”  his lawyer, jim walden, said after the decision, “wada’s decision to reinstate russia represents the greatest treachery against clean athletes in olympic history.”       ',\n",
       " 'america’s best gymnasts have shaken their heads for years at the failure of their national federation to understand the blighted culture of their sport, one that allowed a team doctor to abuse them for decades while the sport’s leaders looked the other way.  a turning point appeared to come last winter in a michigan courtroom. there, for nearly a week, more than 100 girls and women riveted a national audience with  stories of sexual abuse  and institutional neglect as lawrence g. nassar, the longtime national team doctor, sat listening a few feet away before a judge  sentenced him  to essentially a life term in prison.  yet just seven months later, the leadership of their sport let them down all over again, the gymnasts say, by not seeking their opinions on crucial moves, decisions that were among the reasons the united states olympic committee moved monday to strip the federation of its governing powers.  first, u.s.a. gymnastics, the troubled national governing body, gave a powerful position to a coach who had a history of defending nassar and a reputation, among many former gymnasts, for pushing athletes to unnecessary extremes and haranguing them about their weight.        the  appointment of that coach, mary lee tracy , who had four decades of experience, fell apart quickly. the complaints it generated forced the organization’s chief executive to resign.  just weeks later, the federation’s board appointed  mary bono , a former congresswoman, to serve as u.s.a. gymnastics’ interim chief executive. she lasted five days.  bono resigned under pressure after several prominent athletes complained about her lobbying work for a law firm that had advised u.s.a. gymnastics in 2015 when the organization delayed publicly revealing reports about nassar’s assaults.  as the federation enters a phase that may lead to its demise, longtime gymnasts remain befuddled over the mismanaged hiring. for them, the choices, most emblematically the tracy decision, illustrated a continuing dysfunction in an organization they see as incapable of understanding the drastic changes needed to create a healthy environment for gymnasts at every level.  a cursory search of the internet would have revealed tracy defending nassar and calling him “amazing” in a 2016 television interview — after the first wave of accusations against him, from more than 50 athletes, was made public. diligent outreach to gymnasts who trained under tracy, or those who knew her athletes, would most likely have uncovered allegations of a physically and emotionally abusive atmosphere at her gym.        a spokesman for u.s.a. gymnastics declined to comment on the hiring process for tracy.  in an interview last month, tracy said she had evolved as a coach over the last 10 years. “i’m not proud of some of the times in my early days of coaching,” she said. “i’m the first one to say that i yelled too much at kids and i weighed kids, and i certainly don’t do that anymore.” tracy has also called nassar a monster, repudiating her comments in the television interview.  dominique moceanu, a gold medalist on the 1996 olympic team who trained at tracy’s cincinnati gymnastics academy in the early 2000s, said she began texting with other gymnasts as soon as she learned that tracy had been named the federation’s elite development coordinator.  “after so many poor decisions, everybody was like, ‘seriously, you chose her?’” said moceanu, who recently opened a gym in ohio. “you don’t know the eating disorders that have come out of her gym, or the problem with injuries that have come out of her gym? have you not done any of your homework?’”  morgan white, a tracy protégé who made the olympic team in 2000, never publicly discussed what she had endured as a gymnast until tracy was chosen for the coordinator’s job in august. white remembers feeling nauseated when she heard the news — and decided to speak up.  at the time, white, 34, was recovering from a total hip replacement. she has had three hip operations, which she believes were necessitated by years of overtraining under tracy’s guidance .              image     morgan white, a former elite gymnast who trained under mary lee tracy, outside her home in cincinnati. white said her coach mistreated her.   credit  maddie mcgarvey for the new york times         the coach repeatedly called her fat, encouraging eating disorders that have persisted, white said, and also persuaded her to hide injuries when she was under consideration for national teams. at a training camp before the sydney olympics, white said, tracy coerced her to forgo a protective boot and icing sessions on an injured foot so that the national team coordinators would not automatically deny her a spot on the olympic team. white ultimately pulled out of the games because of the injury.        nassar offered her friendship during those tough times, she said. several gymnasts have said the doctor’s positive attitude was partly why they did not challenge him as he molested them under the guise of medical treatment.  once when white was in a car with nassar during a training camp, “he comforted me and rubbed my leg and said everything was going to be o.k., and that it wasn’t fair that mary lee was treating me this way,” she said. “he was the good guy in a sport of cruel people. he had already assaulted me by then.”  white, a plaintiff in one of the many lawsuits against u.s.a.g., said nassar started abusing her when she was 16.            image        white, center, received the gold medal in the gymnastics all-around event at the 1999 pan american games in winnipeg, manitoba.   credit  associated press/eduardo di baia         tracy, however, has described white as one of her “all-time favorite” athletes. “i feel like i was a good friend and a good coach to morgan white,” she said, adding that she had frequently encouraged white to put on weight.  she said white had insisted on hiding the foot injury, which included not wearing a protective boot or icing the injury, and she said it was not uncommon for a star athlete to push through an injury, with the blessing of the parents, who don’t want to derail their child’s olympic goals.  “if i was such an awful person, then why did you keep driving your daughter to practice, sometimes twice a day, six days a week, and then pay me $300, $500 a month for it?” tracy said.        tracy also said that she had immediately reported a possible case of sexual misconduct to u.s.a. gymnastics in 2015 after a mother called her to say that marvin sharp, the federation’s 2010 coach of the year, had taken a lewd photograph of her daughter.  sharp was arrested  on charges of child molestation and sexual misconduct, and he hanged himself in jail.  tracy has many supporters on all levels of the sport, including jennie leonard, who competed as jennie thompson on seven national teams, three of them under tracy’s command. she said tracy “kind of became my mom and was a very caring person.” tracy was obsessed with educating herself on safer training methods, leonard said, and would have been “an amazing choice” for the elite coordinator’s job.  “i think some people are getting an unfair shake right now,” leonard said.  tracy said she applied for the u.s.a. gymnastics development job in august through a posting on the federation’s website and about a week later was interviewed by three federation officials at the national championships in boston.  tracy said they asked her questions like, “what would you do if you saw a coach verbally abusing an athlete at a camp or training event?” and made other queries that focused on athlete safety. she said she was asked if she had had any contact with nassar survivors, and she said yes.  tracy’s appointment was  announced on aug. 28 . within a day, a backlash began among several nassar victims, with the three-time olympic gold medalist aly raisman leading the way.  “usa gymnastics has appointed someone who, in my view, supported nassar, victim-shamed survivors &amp; has shown no willingness to learn from the past,” raisman wrote on twitter. “this is a slap in the face for survivors and further confirmation that nothing at usag has changed.”          tracy said kerry perry, the chief executive of the gymnastics federation, contacted her three days after the appointment and asked for her resignation, citing tracy’s contact with plaintiffs in one of the many lawsuits that the organization faces because of nassar’s crimes.        “nobody told me i couldn’t talk to survivors,” tracy said.  perry, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, was forced out less than a week later, after nine months as the organization’s president and chief executive.  perry’s departure left a power vacuum: the federation’s office in indianapolis had no leader, and the task of finding a replacement fell to an inexperienced board of directors that had not been assembled until june. the previous board was forced to resign in the wake of the wrenching testimony at nassar’s sentencing hearings.  in october, sarah hirshland, chief executive of the united states olympic committee, sent along the names of bono and another potential candidate to the gymnastics federation’s acting leadership, suggesting that the board interview them for the open chief executive’s job. bono, who had competed in gymnastics, quickly stepped into the interim job. the u.s.o.c. had vetted her credentials, and checked her social media activity.            image        mary bono, a former member of the house of representatives, was named the interim chief executive of u.s.a. gymnastics last month. she lasted five days in the job.   credit  richard lui/the desert sun, via associated press         just as quickly came another uprising from gymnasts, over bono’s lobbying work and a tweet of hers that  opposed nike’s ad campaign featuring colin kaepernick , the former n.f.l. quarterback who knelt during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. the u.s.o.c. had noted this tweet in its report.  “what people keep missing is that this is not a larry nassar story,” said  rachael denhollander , a lawyer and a former gymnast who was the first person to publicly accuse nassar of assault. “larry was just a symptom of the real problem at u.s.a.g. because it fostered an abusive culture for decades.”        last month, the gymnastics federation began searching for its next chief executive and sent an online survey to more than 200 people who are considered vital stakeholders in the sport.  the questions included:  “what three characteristics of the next c.e.o. do you see as being most important?”  (possible multiple-choice responses: a good listener? knowledgeable about gymnastics?)  “what would you like to see changed about u.s.a.g.?”  “please describe u.s.a.g.’s current culture in three words.”  the survey wasn’t out long before the u.s.o.c. moved to sever its ties with the gymnastics federation, which may have to declare bankruptcy in response to the lawsuits against it. now u.s.a. gymnastics, in its current incarnation, may not get a chance to hire anyone else.

       " \"during the 2017 united states open,  serena williams , holder of 23 grand slam titles, was fighting for her life. she had just given birth to alexis olympia ohanian jr. by cesarean section and faced life-threatening  complications  from a pulmonary embolism and blood clotting.  she would be bedridden for six weeks.   one year later, she is back on the u.s. open courts, attempting to tie margaret court’s record of 24 grand slam titles.   her return, which has included a run to the wimbledon final in july, should be surprising to exactly no one. williams has joined a league of simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary women, those who return to work after childbirth and quickly perform at a very high level. elite athletes just have a different kind of office environment awaiting them.   in 1960, two years after giving birth to her daughter, the sprinter  wilma rudolph  won three gold medals at the rome olympics.  sheryl swoopes  returned to the basketball court six weeks after giving birth to her son. she led the houston comets to the 1997 w.n.b.a. championship. the scottish golfer catriona matthew won the women’s british open in august 2009, 10 weeks after giving birth to her second daughter. the british heptathlete jessica ennis-hill gave birth to her first son in july 2014. she won gold at the world championships 13 months later.        because of a lack of scientific data, there are few studies on elite athletes who give birth and return to the highest levels of competition soon thereafter, said dr. miho tanaka\\u200b, director of the women’s sports medicine program at johns hopkins.             image     wilma rudolph, on her way to three gold medals at the 1960 olympics, as the mother of a toddler.   credit  associated press

toward individualized recommendations and their innate ability to be hyper-aware of their own bodies. whatever attributes allow elite athletes to get to their level of fitness and bounce back from injury with greater speed can surely help them return to sport after childbirth, tanaka said. “but what that mechanism is — whether that’s physical or mental, or both — that formula would be hard to translate.”   dr. cordelia carter, director of the women’s sports medicine center at n.y.u. langone health, said williams had an uncomplicated pregnancy but a very complicated postpartum period, and she continues to achieve above and beyond what many, rightly or wrongly, thought was possible. “so looking at her, we don’t yet know our limits, which is powerful,” she said.        it always has

       " 'the international olympic committee’s handling of russia’s systemic doping program has been plunged into disarray after sport’s top court overturned bans issued to 28 russian athletes just days before the start of the winter games in pyeongchang, south korea.  the court of arbitration for sport ruled thursday that there was insufficient evidence that the athletes — including some medal winners — breached antidoping regulations at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia. the reversal means athletes deemed to have been part of an elaborate cheating scheme may yet compete in the olympics. it is yet another blow to the credibility of the olympic committee’s management of the doping affair.  the outcome raises yet more troubling questions about the lengthy and complicated process that defined the i.o.c’s treatment of the affair, and why experts in sporting jurisprudence, including i.o.c. president thomas bach, failed to predict thursday’s outcome. bach once led the court’s appeals division, and john coates, a longtime senior i.o.c. member, is president of the court’s top board.  skeptics say the judgment allows the i.o.c. the fig leaf of talking tough, while at the same time making decisions that it knowingly knew could be successfully challenged on appeal.        the scandal first surfaced on the eve of the rio de janeiro summer games in 2016. in december, after a lengthy and much-delayed investigation, a slew of athletes, coaches and officials were hit with sanctions, and the russian olympic committee was barred from attending the pyeongchang games.  in a move criticized by many in the global antidoping community, the international olympic committee ruled that clean russian individuals could compete in separate uniforms designating them as “olympic athletes from russia,” should they satisfy a review panel.  on tuesday, 169 athletes from russia were cleared to participate, making the contingent one of the largest at the games, and just eight short of the 177 sent to compete in vancouver, british columbia, in 2010.  russia’s deputy prime minister, vitaly mutko, a former sports minister now serving a life suspension from the olympics, said the government would support further legal action to ensure the additional athletes cleared on thursday could compete in pyeongchang.  “if the i.o.c. does not accept them, then we will support them in cases which could be filed at c.a.s. and other legal instances,” mutko said in televised comments, referring to the sports court.        the international olympic committee insisted that it retained the authority to decide who would be allowed to compete, regardless of the court’s decision.  “the result of the c.a.s. decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the games,” it said. “not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation.”  the sports court said it overturned the doping bans because “the evidence collected was found to be insufficient to establish that an antidoping rule violation was committed by the athletes concerned.”  the court found that 11 of the athletes had broken those rules, and upheld the ban on their competing in pyeongchang, but it ruled that they could compete in future olympics. three appeals are pending, and one of the 43 athletes did not appeal the sanctions.  russia celebrated the ruling. a state-backed sports broadcaster aired the nearly two-hour cross-country ski race won in 2014 by alexander legkov, one of the athletes whose appeal was upheld.  “we insisted from the very start that our athletes are not involved in any doping schemes, and, of course, we are now just happy that their honest name has been reinstated by court and all their awards have been returned to them,” said alexander zhukov, head of the russian olympic committee.  “it proves our position that the vast majority of our athletes are clean,” russian president vladimir v. putin said in televised comments from rostov-on-don. “we should also respect the side which we were in dispute with. that’s why there should not be any sense of euphoria from our side, we should be calm about it.”        the court of arbitration noted that it was not passing judgment on “whether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples in the sochi laboratory,” but on the culpability of individual athletes.  in its statement, the i.o.c. lamented that the court of arbitration had not taken into account the “proven existence of the systematic manipulation of the antidoping system” by russia.  the case against russia was largely built on the bombshell testimony of the former head of its drug testing laboratory, grigory rodchenkov. rodchenkov, now living in hiding in the united states, detailed how he had formulated cocktails of banned substances to athletes and swapped the tainted samples under the direction of government officials.  his testimony backed up laboratory data that allowed the olympic committee to essentially concur with the conclusions about the existence of a systematic doping scheme made in a 2016 investigation by the canadian lawyer richard mclaren. thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee, described it is an “unprecedented attack on the integrity of the olympic games and sport.”  rodchenkov, the whistle-blower, had alleged that russia had found a way to pry open supposedly tamper-proof drug-testing bottles and replace their contents without detection.  the arbitration panel rejected 11 appeals, including that of the two-time bobsled gold medalist alexandr zubkov. his retested samples had abnormal levels of salt, a substance, according to rodchenkov, that was used to cover up doping violations in the swapped samples.  mclaren and rodchenkov provided testimony to the russian appeals hearings via video link. they were not interviewed by the olympic committee panel that issued the original ban on the russian athletes.        “clean sport is dead,” rodchenkov’s lawyer jim walden said. “the c.a.s. decision proves that certain countries can get away with anything and everything. today’s decision will forever stand as the low point in sports integrity.”  “this panel’s unfortunate decision provides a very small measure of punishment for some athletes, but a complete ‘get out of jail free card’ for most. thus, the c.a.s. decision only emboldens cheaters, makes it harder for clean athletes to win and provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt russian doping system generally, and putin specifically.”  handling the fallout from the scandal has been a draining and damaging experience for the international olympic committee’s leadership. the run-up to the rio olympics was marred by indecision over whether to allow russia to participate. the committee tossed the decision to individual federations, which led to some, including track and field, to issue a near-blanket ban on russians. that ban remains in place.  organizers of the paralympics were more decisive, announcing a ban on the entire russian contingent. last week, they announced that ban remains in place, refusing to lift the restriction because of what they called an insufficient recovery from the doping scandal.

       " 'three weeks before the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, sports officials are still deliberating which russian athletes will receive special clearance to compete, stirring speculation that the international olympic committee’s ban on russia for its doping schemes will ultimately prove less severe than it was billed.  a panel appointed by the i.o.c. last month has received applications from hundreds of russian athletes who hope to compete in pyeongchang. (because russia’s olympic team is technically barred, the athletes would compete under the olympic flag.) that panel is expected to conclude its review within the next week, ruling on which russians have effectively demonstrated that they are clean and should be given the chance to circumvent the  ban on their nation  for systematic  cheating at the last winter games .  but even once that participant list is established, the 2018 olympic roster will be far from fixed. before the end of the month, an international sports court is due to hear the appeals of  39 russian athletes  whom the i.o.c. barred for having doped at the 2014 games.  future appeals may take issue with the opaqueness of the process by which the i.o.c. is reviewing russian athletes’ eligibility — something a group of antidoping officials criticized forcefully on thursday. after a summit in bonn, germany, officials from 20 nations urged the olympic review panel — which is led by france’s former sports minister and includes representatives from the i.o.c. and the top regulator of drugs in sports — to publish firm standards to be applied consistently to potential olympians from russia.        “robust and demanding criteria, as well as the names of russian athletes with their individual testing histories who have met them, need to be published as soon as possible,” the antidoping leaders said in a statement.  the olympic review panel that will issue invitations to russian athletes is led by valérie fourneyron, france’s former sports minister and the current chairwoman of a new global drug-testing authority created by the i.o.c. it also includes günter younger, the director of intelligence and investigations for the world anti-doping agency who previously worked for interpol in germany; pedro goncalves, a project manager for the doping-free sport unit who is overseeing pre-games testing of all olympic athletes; and richard budgett, the medical and scientific director of the i.o.c.  as pyeongchang’s feb. 9 opening ceremony approaches, the unsettled roster of russian athletes — as well as the friction between sports officials and antidoping enforcers — has echoed the disarray of the last olympics. at the 2016 rio games, russian athletes were presumed tainted by their nation’s state-backed doping program unless they proved otherwise. that prompted a flood of legal disputes, with athletes petitioning to compete even after the games had begun.  the antidoping officials who spoke out thursday — representing countries that included australia, canada, japan and the united kingdom — urged the i.o.c. not to grant entry to any of the hundreds of russian athletes who have been implicated by past investigations into russian doping or by a trove of  drug-testing data  obtained by global sports regulators from moscow last fall.  they called for any russian athletes who are granted competition slots in pyeongchang to have a minimum of one year of rigorous drug-testing outside of russia. russia’s antidoping agency has been deemed noncompliant by the global regulator of drugs in sports for more than two years.        days ago, at a tournament in siberia, three dozen russian athletes abruptly withdrew from a regional competition after drug-testing officials had arrived unannounced, according to russian media. many said they were ill, and russia’s track and field association said it had launched an investigation into the mass withdrawals.  on thursday, the i.o.c. announced that more than 14,000 doping tests had been conducted on over 6,000 athletes from 61 countries “to optimize the protection of clean athletes ahead of pyeongchang.”  “with extra scrutiny on russian athletes, november and december saw testing on double the number of athletes from russia than any other country,” the i.o.c.  statement  said. the organization touted not just a higher volume of tests across countries but the use of intelligence to focus on possible likely violators.  “this more targeted testing focuses on specific disciplines and nationalities that are at particular risk, as well as individual athletes and groups of athletes selected based on their ranking, and any suspicious change in performance or adverse testing history,” the statement said.  russian athletes implicated in the nation’s doping scandal have continued to compete not just nationally but also in global competitions. on thursday, the antidoping officials urged olympic executives not to grant entry to any russian athlete with a pending disciplinary case.  numerous such russian olympians whom the i.o.c. has barred for cheating at the 2014 games have continued to compete in their sports’ major international competitions this season and dominate standings. some have qualified for the olympics though they are prohibited to attend them — skewing global rankings and precluding other athletes from qualifying for their countries’ olympic teams. in certain sports with unique qualification rules, barred athletes have earned points for their nation that could enable another russian athlete to have a place at the games.  russian officials, including president vladimir v. putin, have decried the olympic ban while signaling satisfaction that russian athletes will still be able to compete with a reference to their nationality, each identified as an “olympic athlete from russia.”        on wednesday, the russian equivalent of the f.b.i.  pushed back  on factual conclusions that had informed the i.o.c. ban, disputing scientific analysis of urine samples and again questioning the credibility of whistle-blower witnesses.  “the i.o.c. claims to have banned the entire russian olympic committee, and they’re examining the basis on which they should invite any russian athletes,” said travis t. tygart, the chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency, who was among the officials who met in germany this week and spoke out on thursday.  “if there are 232 russian athletes in pyeongchang — the same number that was in sochi — then the i.o.c. will have pulled off a total scam.”       ',\n",
       " 'in an effort to address questions about fair play, track and field’s world governing body will publish regulations on thursday that could force some elite female athletes with naturally elevated testosterone levels to lower the hormone with medication, compete against men in certain olympic events or effectively give up their international careers.  the rules, scheduled to take effect in november, will initially be enforced in middle distance races of 400 meters to one mile. these distances, which synthesize the need for speed, power and endurance, are events in which raised testosterone levels can have the most profound influence on performances, the sport’s top officials say.  the regulations are certain to cause further controversy, and perhaps bring another legal challenge to the most elemental of sports, in which competition is divided into male and female categories, while biological sex is not nearly so neat and binary. track and field has gone through contortions on this issue for years, most visibly regarding caster semenya of south africa, a dominant middle distance runner and two-time olympic champion at 800 meters.  female track athletes with elevated levels of testosterone, a condition known as hyperandrogenism, will be required to lower the amount of the hormone circulating in their blood for six months before being allowed to compete from the quarter-mile to the mile in major international events like the olympics and the world championships.        the affected athletes — characterized in the regulations as “athletes with differences of sexual development” — will then have to maintain those lower levels to remain eligible for international meets.  if they do not, they will be faced with difficult choices — hormone therapy; restricting their performances to national meets; competing against men; entering events for so-called intersex athletes, if any are offered; moving to longer or shorter distances; or essentially giving up their chance to participate in the sport’s most prestigious competitions.  the regulations are meant to ensure “fair and meaningful competition within the female classification,” according to track’s governing body, the international association of athletics federations, known as the i.a.a.f.  athletes will not be required to undergo surgery to lower their hormone levels, the i.a.a.f. said, adding that the regulations are “in no way intended as any kind of judgment on, or questioning of, the sex or the gender identity of any athlete.”  the regulations will affect female track athletes with naturally occurring testosterone levels above five nanomoles per liter. according to the i.a.a.f., most women, including elite female athletes, have testosterone levels from 0.12 to 1.79 nanomoles per liter, while the normal male range is 7.7 to 29.4 nanomoles per liter.        with testosterone levels between five and 10 nanomoles per liter, the i.a.a.f. said, women gain a clear performance advantage derived from a 4.4 percent increase in muscle mass, a 12 percent to 26 percent increase in muscle strength and a 7.8 percent increase in hemoglobin, which transports oxygen in red blood cells.  “to the best of our knowledge, there is no other genetic or biological trait encountered in female athletics that confers such a huge performance advantage,” the i.a.a.f. said in the regulations and supporting documents obtained by the new york times.  the regulations follow a 2017 study, commissioned by the i.a.a.f. and published in the british journal of sports medicine, which showed that women with elevated testosterone levels gained a competitive advantage from 1.78 percent to 4.53 percent in events such as the 400 meters, the 400-meter hurdles, the 800 meters, the hammer throw and the pole vault.  even a small edge can mean the difference between a gold, silver or bronze medal, or finishing off the podium entirely, in events decided by tenths or hundredths of a second, the i.a.a.f. said.  the regulations represent an attempt by the i.a.a.f. to reinstate rules governing female athletes with elevated testosterone levels, which were suspended in 2015 by the swiss-based court of arbitration for sport, a rough equivalent of the supreme court for international sports.  the court ruled then that the i.a.a.f. had not sufficiently quantified the performance advantage gained by athletes with raised testosterone levels. that case involved an indian sprinter named dutee chand. the new regulations would not affect her events, the 100 and 200 meters.  many factors affect performance, and the i.a.a.f. has struggled to show conclusively that elevated testosterone provided women with more of a significant competitive edge than factors like nutrition, age, height, weight, access to coaching and training facilities, and other genetic and biological variations like oxygen-carrying capacity.        even before being officially published, the new i.a.a.f. regulations have come under criticism.  because the hammer throw and the pole vault, which showed the highest performance advantage for women with elevated testosterone in the 2017 i.a.a.f. study, are not included in the new rules, the regulations appear to be arbitrary and political and not based on solid science, said katrina karkazis, a bioethicist and visiting senior fellow at the global health justice partnership at yale, who has written extensively on hyperandrogenism and athletic performance.  “just when i thought it couldn’t get any worse, it has,” she said in a telephone interview on wednesday.  she and others have argued that the i.a.a.f.’s rules will force some women to undergo hormone therapy that could adversely affect their health; will be humiliating; will disproportionately affect women from developing nations who do not conform to western standards of femininity; and will ultimately lead to some elite women quitting the sport.  female athletes with elevated testosterone levels will essentially face a “choice of no choice,” ms. karkazis said.  much of the debate about female athletes and hyperandrogenism has focused on semenya, winner of the 800 meters at the 2012 and 2016 summer olympics.  at the recent commonwealth games, held in australia, where semenya won the 800 and 1,500 meters, an australian runner named brittany mcgowan expressed her frustration about competing against athletes with elevated testosterone, telling reporters, “it’s tough for a lot of women in the 800 meters, 400 meters and 1,500 meters at the moment to compare ourselves and be judged by our governing bodies on those times.”  but a study published in april in the journal of sports sciences noted that semenya’s average faster speed of 1.49 percent in the 800 fell far short of the 10 percent performance advantage that men generally have over women.        paul melia, the president and chief executive of the canadian centre for ethics in sport, said in an interview from ottawa on wednesday that because athletes with hyperandrogenism identify and live as females, and present physically as females, “they have a human right to participate in sport in the gender they identify with.”  mr. melia continued: “if the i.a.a.f. applies that policy and a woman whose naturally occurring testosterone falls outside that range, they’re going to say to her: ‘we’re not preventing you from competing. you can compete with males.’ i don’t think that’s right.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — to say the winter olympics are not racially diverse is like noting the weather in pyeongchang is cold. this is not surprising.  the winter games have deep scandinavian roots, and draw athletes from the colder, predominantly white — and often wealthy — regions of the united states, germany and austria.  but looking across social media as the games pick up, some of the biggest stars have been an unexpectedly diverse group.  with viral videos, trending topics and plenty of gifs, the internet has crowned some of the early fan favorites as the american speedskater maame biney, the jamaican women’s bobsled team and, adding to momentum they built up long before the opening ceremony friday, the  nigerian women’s bobsled team  (not to mention the  shirtless tongan  competing improbably as a cross-country skier after flaming out in taekwondo at the 2016 summer olympics).        they are not necessarily medal contenders, nor underdogs. and their outsize presence on social media belies the reality on the ground here of an overwhelming white population of athletes.  the undeniable advantage in the winter games has long gone to nations with the strongest national governing bodies, which are the biggest financing system for athletes in training.  the jamaican bobsled athlete jazmine fenlator-victorian knows that advantage firsthand. a new jersey native, she was recruited by the united states to bobsledding as a 22-year-old and competed in the 2014 sochi olympics. yet fenlator-victorian, a dual citizen of the united states and jamaica, decided to represent jamaica in the pyeongchang games.  “it’s important to me that little girls and boys see someone that looks like them, talks like them, has the same culture as them, has crazy curly hair and wears it natural, has brown skin-included in different things in this world,” she said, fighting back tears.              image     the jamaican women’s bobsled team during the winter olympics opening ceremony. they have drawn many fans online.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         “when you grow up and you don’t see that, you feel that you can’t do it and that is not right,” she said. “so coming back home to jamaica, i wanted my jamaican people to see that they can do it … if they want to be a winter olympian and do alpine ski, now they see their fellow jamaican in the winter olympics.”  nearly 3,000 athletes from 92 countries are competing in the pyeongchang olympics. six of those nations — ecuador, eritrea, kosovo, malaysia, nigeria and singapore — are competing in the winter olympics for the first time.  asia has also become a major force in the olympics movement as the host for the next two games after pyeongchang. the next summer olympics will be held in tokyo in 2020, and the next winter olympics will be held in beijing in 2022.  for its part, the united states olympic committee said that its team is the most diverse it has fielded at a winter olympics.  of the 243 athletes, 10 are african-american and 10 are asian-american. the u.s.o.c. does not release data on other racial and ethnic groups because the national governing bodies for individual sports collect and report the data and have done so inconsistently (the sports ask but do not require athletes to report their racial and ethnic identities).  jason thompson, the director of diversity and inclusion at the committee, said progress has been made in fielding a more diverse team, but that more needs to be done to recruit athletes across racial and ethnic groups.        “i think we’re not where we want to be,” he said, “but it’s a huge jump to show that winter sports are for everybody.”  the sports that have seen the biggest increase in racial diversity are those drawing so-called crossover athletes — those talented in one sport who adapt to a new one.              “sometimes it’s just that they haven’t been introduced to the sport,” thompson said. many bobsled athletes, for example, are former elite track sprinters.  this year’s delegation includes erin jackson, the first african-american woman to qualify for the united states long-track speedskating team, and jordan greenway,  the first black hockey player    on the    men’s team .  biney, an effervescent 17-year-old and the first african-american woman to compete for the united states in speedskating at the winter olympics, has quickly become a social media darling.  she was born in ghana and moved to the united states at the age of 5. she learned how to skate soon after, but her coach told her father she was too fast for figure skating. so she enrolled in speedskating.        “i think it hit, i think it finally hit,” biney said at the opening ceremony. “i’m actually here at the olympic games. holy cow. it’s awesome.”          on jan. 3, biney  tweeted her thanks  to “the real mvp,” shani davis, who is competing in his fifth olympics. in 2006, at the turin olympics, davis became the first african-american to win an individual gold medal at the winter games.  in her twitter post, biney said of davis: “you’ve inspired me and paved the way as the first african-american speed skater to make an olympic team.”  davis has been in conflict with the u.s.o.c. after it used a coin flip to decide which athlete out of two finalists would carry the american flag in the opening ceremony.            image        biney racing in the 500 meters on saturday. she is the first african-american woman to compete for the united states in speedskating at the olympics.   credit  bernat armangue/associated press         the committee, he said in a twitter post last week, “dishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer.”        “no problem,” he added. “i can wait until 2022. #blackhistorymonth2018 #pyeongchang2018”  davis has not commented since, and has made his  twitter account  private, leaving others to interpret what he meant by the black history month reference.  if biney is feeling the pressure of paving the way for the next generation of african-american women entering the sport, she is taking it with stride. she was full of laughter on saturday shortly after securing her spot in the final 16 in the 500 meters. “i’m just ready to get out there on tuesday and let it rip,” she said.  thirteen athletes from eight african nations will be competing in south korea, the largest representation of athletes from african nations in any winter games. there has yet to be a winter olympics medal awarded to any athlete representing an african nation.  the nigerian bobsled team has high, perhaps sky high, expectations to change that.  they make up the  first african nation  to compete in bobsled at the olympics, and, win or lose, they said that they hope to make a lasting impression.  “this could be something that would be really cool, something that we give back, something that people could just be proud of and we could be just kind of low key, get it done, and we could just live in that legacy,” seun adigun, the captain and driver of the team, said in pyeongchang. “or, people would get really, really excited, and then we’d have to figure out how to manage life that way.”  they already are celebrities in the athletes’ village.          yet they did not get to the games easily.  just the cost of equipment and travel can quickly overwhelm an athlete reaching for qualification. and for nations without olympic delegations, much of the work that normally falls on organizing bodies instead falls on the athletes.        nigeria had no bobsled federation until the women on the team created one.  adigun raised a total of $150,000 on  gofundme , a crowdsourcing website, to help fund her team’s training and gear.  the team is now featured in  beats by dre ads  and is a part of  team visa promotions .  they, along with the team from jamaica, will take their first olympic run on  feb. 20 .

       " 'on the morning of may 6, 1954, a thursday, roger bannister, 25, a medical student in london, worked his usual shift at st. mary’s hospital and took an early afternoon train to oxford. he had lunch with some old friends, then met a couple of his track teammates, christopher chataway and chris brasher. as members of an amateur all-star team, they were preparing to run against oxford university.  about 1,200 people showed up at oxford’s unprepossessing iffley road track to watch, and though the day was blustery and damp — inauspicious conditions for a record-setting effort — a record is what they saw. paced by chataway and brasher and powered by an explosive kick, his signature, bannister ran a mile in under four minutes — 3:59.4, to be exact — becoming the first man ever to do so, breaking through a mystical barrier and creating a seminal moment in sports history.  bannister’s feat was trumpeted on front pages around the world. he had reached “one of man’s hitherto unattainable goals,”  the new york times declared . his name, like those of babe ruth, bobby jones and jesse owens, became synonymous with singular athletic achievement.  then, astonishingly — at least from the vantage point of the 21st century — bannister, at the height of his athletic career, retired from competitive running later that year, to concentrate on medicine.        “now that i am taking up a hospital appointment,” he said in an address to the english sportswriters association that december, “i shall have to give up international athletics. i shall not have sufficient time to put up a first-class performance. there would be little satisfaction for me in a second-rate performance, and it would be wrong to give one when representing my country.”  after a long career as a neurologist, both in research and clinical practice, bannister, who was knighted in 1975, died on saturday in oxford, his family confirmed in a statement on sunday. he was 88.  his record-setting feat would be surpassed many times. runners in the next decades would be faster, stronger, better-equipped, better-trained and able to devote much of their time to the pursuit while benefiting from advances in sports science. but their later success did not dim the significance of bannister’s run.  “he was running on 28 training miles a week,” sebastian coe, who set the world record in the mile three different times, once said. “he did it on limited scientific knowledge, with leather shoes in which the spikes alone probably weighed more than the tissue-thin shoes today, on tracks at which speedway riders would turn up their noses. so as far as i’m concerned, that was one of the great runs of all time.”  tall and lanky with a long, forceful stride and a blond head that usually bobbed above his competitors’ in a race, bannister was a gentleman athlete with a philosophical turn of mind. he was a quiet, unassuming champion, a character of a type that has seemingly vanished in the modern era of sports celebrity. sports illustrated called him “among the most private of public men, inexhaustibly polite, cheerfully distant, open and complex.”        his 1955 memoir — called “the four-minute mile,” and reissued 50 years later as “the first four minutes” — amounted to a portrait of the athlete as a young artist. in a typically analytic and introspective passage, he described the moment at which a runner decides to break from the pack and take the lead:  “the decision to ‘break away’ results from a mixture of confidence and lack of it. the ‘breaker’ is confident to the extent that he suddenly decides the speed has become slower than he can himself sustain to the finish. hence he can accelerate suddenly and maintain his new speed to the tape. but he also lacks confidence, feeling that unless he makes a move now, everyone else will do so and he will be left standing.  “the spurt is extremely wasteful because it is achieved at the cost of relaxation,” he went on, “which should be maintained throughout the race. the athlete’s style and mood change completely when he accelerates. his mind suddenly starts driving an unwilling body which only obeys under the stimulus of the excitement. the earlier in the race this extra energy is thrown in, the greater the lead captured, but the less chance of holding it.”  the idea at the heart of this passage — that you must seize the right moment or risk its passing forever — was very much a factor in bannister’s record-setting run. milers had been flirting with four minutes for at least a decade. the swedish runner arne andersson ran a 4:01.6 in 1944; the next year, his countryman gunder hägg sliced two-tenths of a second from the world record.  it had gone no lower before bannister toed the starting line at iffley road, but it was widely believed that the four-minute barrier was on the verge of falling, and that one of three men — bannister, the australian john landy and the american wes santee — would bring it down. (landy became the second to do so; santee never did.)            image     bannister, near collapse after his come-from-behind victory in the “miracle mile” race in which he caught australia’s john landy in the final lap to win in 3:58.8, to landy’s 3:59.6.   credit  associated press         the meet in oxford was bannister’s first in eight months, and he had been training seriously for six of them. as the year went on, he would face far stiffer competition, but with brasher (later an olympic steeplechase champion) and chataway (later the world record holder at 5,000 meters) enlisted as his supporting cast, he chose may 6 and the familiar iffley road track, where he’d run as an oxford man himself, as the time and place for his assault on the four-minute mark.  the unpromising weather nearly persuaded him to call off the attempt, run an ordinary race and save the more intensive effort for a meet in london scheduled 10 days later. this was no small decision.        “failure is as exciting to watch as success, provided the effort is absolutely genuine and complete,” he wrote in his memoir. “but the spectators fail to understand — and how can they know — the mental agony through which an athlete must pass before he can give his maximum effort. and how rarely, if he is built as i am, he can give it.”  the wind died down, however, shortly before the race was to begin, and standing at the starting line, bannister made the decision: the attempt was on. with brasher setting the early pace, bannister ran the first quarter mile in 57.5 seconds and the first half mile in 1:58. then chataway took the lead, and after three quarters, the time was 3:00.7. bannister passed him with 300 yards to go.  “those last few seconds seemed never-ending,” bannister wrote. “the faint line of the finishing tape stood ahead as a haven of peace, after the struggle. the arms of the world were waiting to receive me if only i reached the tape without slackening my speed. if i faltered, there would be no arms to hold me and the world would be a cold, forbidding place, because i had been so close. i leapt at the tape like a man taking his last spring to save himself from the chasm that threatens to engulf him.”          roger gilbert bannister was born on march 23, 1929, in the london suburb of harrow. his father, a civil servant, had been a runner, of sorts: he won his school mile, bannister wrote in his memoir, “and promptly fainted afterwards — as so many runners did in those days.”  young roger ran, too, both for the thrill of it, he wrote, and out of fear, to steer clear of bullies and in response to air-raid sirens, which he heard as a boy in world war ii during the battle of britain.  “i imagined bombs and machine guns raining on me if i didn’t go my fastest,” he wrote. “was this a little of the feeling i have now when i shoot into the lead before the last bend and am afraid of a challenge down the finishing straight? to move into the lead means making an attack requiring fierceness and confidence, but fear must play some part in the last stage, when no relaxation is possible and all discretion is thrown to the winds.”        after his family had been evacuated to the city of bath, he earned acceptance at school by winning cross-country races. when he returned to london, however, his school there prized sports like rowing and rugby above running, and his racing career stalled until he entered oxford university, where, at 17, he was introduced to spiked shoes and ran his first mile in 4:53.  by 1952, he was among england’s leading hopes for a gold medal at the helsinki olympic games, but at the last minute, because of the large number of entrants, officials added a semifinal between the qualifying heat and the finals of the 1,500-meter competition. the timing of the extra race disrupted bannister’s regimen of exertion and recovery, and left him depleted. he finished fourth. the sting and shame of the defeat motivated the rest of his running career.  as enduring as it has been in the history of sport, bannister’s record was, in fact, a fleeting one. on june 21, 1954, just weeks after his breakthrough, john landy lowered the world record to 3:58 and set the stage for an epic encounter between the two men at the empire games in vancouver, british columbia.  on aug. 7, before 35,000 spectators, in a race that quickly came to be known as both the “mile of the century” and the “miracle mile,” landy took an early lead but was chased down on the final lap by bannister. both men broke four minutes, with bannister’s winning time, 3:58.8, being his personal best.  landy said afterward, “when i looked ’round in the final back straight and he was still with me, i knew it was curtains.”          bannister later said that vancouver had been a more satisfying race than the celebrated one at iffley road because it was a victory achieved against a great competitor and not merely against a clock. three weeks later, he won another important race, the 1,500 meters at the european championships.        he retired in december, having opened the floodgates for myriad milers to come.  over the next decade, the record for the mile was reduced to 3:54.1. in 1975, the 3:50 barrier was breached for the first time, by john walker of new zealand, and in 1999 hicham el guerrouj, a moroccan, set the current world record of 3:43.13. had they been in the same race, el guerrouj would have beaten bannister by more than 100 meters. (the russian svetlana masterkova holds the women’s record of 4:12.56.)  as it happened, the first week of may 1954 changed bannister’s life in more ways than one. on the day before the race, he met moyra jacobsson, a painter and the daughter of per jacobsson, the swedish economist who became managing director of the international monetary fund. they married the next year.  bannister liked to point out that she didn’t really understand what this running business was all about. “for a time,” he said, “my wife thought i had run four miles in one minute.”  she survives him; his other survivors include two sons, clive and thurstan; and two daughters, erin and charlotte.            image        bannister at his home in oxford, england, in 2012.   credit  andrew testa for the new york times         in addition to his medical career — he became director of the national hospital for nervous diseases in london — bannister, from 1971 to 1974, served as the unpaid chairman of the british sports council, a government-sponsored organization that helped build and maintain sports facilities, and from 1976 to 1983 he was president of the  international council of sport science and physical recreation , an umbrella group, founded in 1958, dedicated to disseminating new findings in sport science and promoting their applications.  from 1985 to 1993, he was the head of pembroke college, oxford.  it was a distinguished life, all the rest of it, however, in the shadow of a single moment, shortly after 6 p.m. on may 6, 1954, when an oxford public address announcer delivered news of a just-completed race to 1,200 apprehensive spectators.        “ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of event no. 9, the one mile,” he said, with dramatic flair and typical british restraint, evidently determined to withhold the crucial information as long as possible. “first, no. 41, r.g. bannister, amateur athletic association and formerly of exeter and merton colleges, oxford, with a time that is a new meeting and track record and which, subject to ratification, will be a new english native, british national, british all-comers, european, british empire and world’s record. the time was 3 …”  the roar of the crowd drowned out the rest.

rules  apply across the board to athletes however they presented at birth. advocates for intersex and transgender athletes have vigorously attacked the international association of athletics federations’ new rules, but they are an extraordinary compromise for women’s sports, including for traditional feminist proponents of equal access to sports for girls and women, guaranteed in the civil rights legislation known as title ix.  understanding the rules and why they make sense is hard. they are based in biology people don’t know or don’t like to talk about and, let’s be honest, at least in some circles, they’re politically incorrect. they force us to talk about women’s bodies when it is increasingly taboo to do so, and they run counter to the movement that seeks to include transgender and intersex people in social institutions based on their gender identity rather than their biology.  these are important progressive developments, but their effects on valuable institutions like women’s sport are real and they need to be understood before positions harden on bad information. pretending that the female body doesn’t exist or that we can’t define the boundaries between men’s and women’s bodies is a bad idea for many reasons. replacing traditional sex classifications with classifications based on gender identity certainly has steep costs in contexts like competitive sport, where the likelihood of success is precisely about sex-specific biology.        a lot has been written about intersex athletes who identify — or are identified in their legal documents — as women. what is important to know is that there are many different intersex conditions, but the i.a.a.f. is only concerned with the subset that involves athletes who are biologically male. they are “in between” only with respect to the pre-birth underdevelopment of their external genitals. intersex athletes who are biologically female aren’t affected by the rules.  specifically, the athletes who are the focus of the i.a.a.f.’s rules are those who have testes. starting in puberty and as adults, their testes produce sperm, not eggs, and supply testosterone in quantities that biologically female bodies and their ovaries never come close to producing.  the male range at its lowest is three times higher than the female range at its highest. at puberty these athletes developed male, not female, secondary sex characteristics: increased muscle mass and strength, including increased heart size; higher hemoglobin levels, which result in better oxygen carrying capacity; and different muscle types and ratios of fat to muscle.  advocates for intersex athletes like to say that sex doesn’t divide neatly. this may be true in gender studies departments, but at least for competitive sports purposes, they are simply wrong. sex in this context is easy to define and the lines are cleanly drawn: you either have testes and testosterone in the male range or you don’t. as the i.a.a.f.’s rules provide, a simple testosterone test establishes this fact one way or the other.  testosterone throughout the life cycle, including puberty, is the reason the best elite females are not competitive in competition against elite males. this 10- to 12-percent sex-based performance gap is well documented by sports and exercise scientists alike. but it isn’t the most important performance gap. rather, that’s the mundane fact that many nonelite males routinely outperform the best elite females.        each year, the world’s best time in the women’s marathon is surpassed by hundreds of men. the women’s world records in all of the races on the track from 100 meters to 10,000 meters are also surpassed by many men each year, including by many high school boys. for example, in 2017, 36 boys ran faster than florence griffith joyner’s seemingly unassailable 100-meter record of 10.49.  there is no characteristic that matters more than testes and testosterone. pick your body part, your geography, and your socioeconomic status and do your comparative homework. starting in puberty there will always be boys who can beat the best girls and men who can beat the best women.  because of this, without a women’s category based on sex, or at least these sex-linked traits, girls and women would not have the chance they have now to develop their athletic talents and reap the many benefits of participating and winning in sports and competition. eric vilain, a geneticist who specializes in differences of sex development, has been blunt about it: removing sex from the eligibility rules would “be a disaster for women’s sport … a sad end to what feminists have wanted for so long.”  this may sound like hyperbole but it isn’t. in competitive sport, winning and room at the top are what ultimately matter, so relative numbers are irrelevant. it doesn’t matter that there are 100 females and three males in a girls’ race if the three males win spots in the final or on the podium because they are males. the unusually high incidence of intersex athletes in the women’s middle distances and their reported 100 percent win share in the women’s 800 meters at the olympic games in rio show their disproportionate power. indeed, it is because they clustered in the middle distances that these events are the initial focus of the rules. their supremacy was proof of principle. testosterone readings outside of the female range were also found in the throws, but these were attributed to doping, not intersex conditions.  the i.a.a.f. is requiring that affected athletes lower their testosterone levels to within the female range if they want to continue competing in the middle distances in the women’s category. by definition, the required hormone therapy causes medically unnecessary physiological change, and no one should be forced to take drugs they don’t want or need.  but the i.a.a.f.’s requirement isn’t rogue or reckless. it simply adopts the standard of care in transition medicine, which is very much embraced by those who seek to match their bodies to their gender identity. intersex athletes who have gone through puberty may not want to drop their testosterone levels to female levels if they don’t identify as female or don’t see the need to feminize their bodies for reasons other than sport. this is especially true for athletes who are in the game to win rather than to express themselves through participation as women. this is properly their choice and it’s a real one.  when we’re not focused on intersex athletes we tend to understand the fact of sex differences and their relevance. in the united states those differences are the basis for title ix and its hugely popular mandate that separate and equal funding be set aside for girls’ and women’s sport. under title ix, sex remains the principal and generally uncontroversial basis for classification and legal protections.  given this, the compromise reflected in the i.a.a.f.’s rules is significant. using testosterone as a proxy for sex may seem like subterfuge, but it’s not. if it were really sex that mattered and not testosterone, then athletes who had gone through puberty as biological males would be categorically banned from the women’s category as they used to be. instead, today, if their legal documents identify them as women they can compete as women in the events they prefer if they transition the single sex trait that determines capacity for the win. they can keep their bodies otherwise intact. the process offers fairness both to the affected athletes and to the field.

       " 'moscow — russian athletes cleared to take part in the coming winter games questioned the selection process that allowed them to compete as neutrals and forced others to stay home while putting a veil of doping suspicion over their careers.  “i think this was a lottery,” sofia prosvirnova, a russian speedskater, said on wednesday ahead of a meeting with president vladimir v. putin of russia. “i know very well the guys who were not allowed to go, and i know 100 percent that they were not guilty of anything.”  last week, the international olympic committee  published a list of 17 factors  it had used to determine whether a russian athlete was eligible to compete. athletes who were implicated in any part of the sprawling investigation into russian doping were not cleared to take part in the games.  mr. putin met with the athletes in his residence near moscow before their departure for the olympics, set to start next week in pyeongchang, south korea. he asked them to put behind thoughts about doping scandals and political intrigue and to concentrate on achieving victories.        “everything that happens around sports and around our athletes should not distract you,” mr. putin  told the cleared olympians . “concentrate on sports, knowing that hundreds of thousands, millions of fans, as usual, are following you, love you and hope you will win.”  after a nominal ban of the russian team from the games, the olympic committee  cleared 169 russian athletes  to compete as “olympic athletes from russia.” this is down from 232 russian olympians who dominated medal rankings at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia. it later appeared that they were dominant  largely because  of a carefully orchestrated cheating scheme.  mr. putin has been denying that any doping plot existed in sochi or that the kremlin ran a state-sponsored doping program in recent years, dismissing the accusations as part of a broad plan to weaken russia and punish it for its sports victories.  on tuesday, mr. putin described grigory rodchenkov, the former head of the moscow antidoping laboratory, as a “nut job” who “should be put in prison.” after fleeing russia, dr. rodchenkov claimed he was responsible for the russian doping program and personally running the doping scheme in sochi.  “everything is based on the testimony of this person,” mr. putin said during a campaign event in moscow. “can you trust him? we are told he is working under the control of american special services.”        mr. putin is set to win re-election in march to stay in the kremlin for a fourth term. he  said earlier  that the doping scandal was a plot to provoke anger among russian sports fans and athletes ahead of the election.  russian athletes, present at the meeting, were equally adamant about the accusations.  “i believe that what happened to our colleagues who are unable to participate in these games is a case of blatant injustice,” alena zavarzina, a russian snowboarder, told the gathering. “it is not fair.”  ilya kovalchuk, a russian ice hockey star, said the fact that many russian athletes were not qualified for the olympics puts more pressure on the hockey team.  “the olympic games is like a birthday party for the i.o.c.; they invite whoever they want,” mr. kovalchuk said before the event. “it is weird because they did not invite leaders from other sports. we are lucky that we are going and it will be even more pressure on us.”  the i.o.c. also ruled that russian athletes would not be allowed to use their national flag and that the national anthem would not be played when they won. at the meeting, many russian athletes wore shirts bearing the slogan “russia in my heart” under their neutral gray-and-red uniforms.  mr. putin was presented with one such jersey, bearing his name and signed by athletes.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — lari lehtonen, an olympic cross-country skier from finland, pulled his two sons out of kindergarten a month ago. they were not allowed to attend birthday parties. they were prohibited from crowded indoor spaces. they could have play dates, but only after a call to the friend’s parents.  this may sound like a peculiar style of helicopter parenting, but lehtonen was not worried about his children — he was worried about himself. specifically, he was worried about catching a cold, and he knew that the more time the lads spent around other children, the more likely they were to become little vectors of disease who could wreck his olympics.  “most of our friends, they know not to invite our boys if someone in their house is sick,” lehtonen said. “but i call or i text to make sure.”  cordoning off the children is just one of a few dozen stay-healthy strategies deployed by athletes here at the olympics.  a norovirus outbreak  — 139 cases and counting as of saturday — has dominated the headlines in the early days of these winter games. but the rhinovirus, the most ubiquitous cause of the common cold, is the challenger every athlete here has been dreading. unlike actual rivals, this one is invisible, omnipresent and tireless.        also, there is no beating it. you can only hope that you avoid it.  dodging an enemy that is everywhere and unseen can make people neurotic. or it can put them in a try-anything frame of mind. or both.  “i used to gargle with salt water every night,” said sara studebaker-hall, a former united states olympian in the biathlon. “my mom is a nurse, and she said there was research that showed that would help. i was, like, great.”  arturs darznieks, a latvian luger,  eats cloves of raw garlic,  a habit he swears does not bother his girlfriend. or his teammates, who have taken to eating cloves of garlic, too.  “we are all stinky in the room,” he said after his second test run down the course on thursday. “but it’s good for your immune system.”        science is not convinced. james gern, a professor at the university of wisconsin-madison who has studied immunology, was skeptical of many of the cold-ducking practices used by olympians. he endorsed the basics, such as sleeping, hand-washing and reducing stress. eating raw garlic? maybe it just keeps people at bay, he guessed. the athlete idea he liked the most belonged to lehtonen, the guy who yanked his children out of kindergarten.            image     arturs darznieks of latvia training on the luge track on thursday. he eats cloves of raw garlic in an attempt to fend off colds.   credit  mark ralston/agence france-presse — getty images         “the most efficient spreaders of rhinovirus are kids,” gern said. “they are totally unhygienic and they need a lot of care. if you live with a 2-year-old who has a cold, just go get yourself a box of tissues.”  the inherent problem is that winter is a  cold-catching season  (and flu, too, especially this year), which means the winter games are a more infection-focused affair than their summer counterparts. and even before the recent outbreak of norovirus, the olympics in pyeongchang seemed determined to turn everyone into a germaphobe.  at incheon airport near seoul, travelers were greeted by a placard about the madagascar plague — turn yourself into the quarantine office was the gist — right before walking through a body-heat detector that flags fevers. on the way to the baggage carousel, a female voice on a recorded message offered a lengthy health-related public service announcement that included the word “vomiting.”  koreans walking around with white face masks are not an uncommon sight here; it is hard to tell if they are contagious or fretting about contagion. there are signs all over the games with instructions for how to cough properly.  into your sleeve, please.  olympians don’t need the pointers. many are acutely aware that they are especially vulnerable during the games. there are athletes coming together from all over the world, some bearing viruses, placed in close quarters, eating in huge cafeterias with serve-yourself buffets.  “i don’t touch the big spoon unless i’m wearing gloves,” said johanna matintalo, another finnish cross-country skier.        matintalo is proof that any contest with the rhinovirus is a gamble, even for someone who bets with care. she caught a cold a week before the games began and has suffered a fate that is familiar to her peers: she’s been banished, at least partially.  “i have my own apartment,” she said. “i should be with my four teammates, in this apartment with five rooms, but they want to wait to make sure that i’m 100 percent.”  the team physician comes and takes a swab from her nose, which is then tested in a piece of equipment that matintalo enthusiastically described as “very cool.” she predicted she would move back in with roommates in another day or two.  the australian team takes a more pitiless approach. the 20 or so members of the squad who have been deemed medal contenders have been hived off to live in what a spokesman called a “sub site” that puts plenty of distance between them and the lesser members of the team.            image        finnish skier johanna matintalo (25) racing on saturday. she caught a cold a week before the games began and was banished to her own apartment, segregated from her teammates.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         the fear of colds is spread evenly throughout the games. it’s prevalent in curling, even among “skips,” whose main job is to stand near the target and shout directions to teammates. compared with a cross-country skier who has to race for 50 kilometers, this is a day off with a cocktail.  but the retired canadian curler kevin martin, who is providing commentary for nbc here, said he was scrupulous about his health because catching a cold while he was competing put his mind in a muddle.        “curling skips are really, really smart and very crafty,” he said. “it’s like a game of chess. you come on to that field of play and you’re not as sharp? oh boy, you’re in trouble.”  many teams have a doctor whose job is to maximize the odds that athletes can travel and compete in the best possible condition. for american biathletes, that is randy wilber, who in january flew from colorado to italy, where the team was competing in a world cup event, to lay out a detailed plan for traveling to pyeongchang.  he offered common sense ideas about jet lag, hygiene, sleep and diet. to some extent, the plan was an end in itself.  “just the fact that you have a plan and you know that it’s been really well thought out by people who’ve worked with hundreds of athletes means you don’t have to worry as much,” said max cobb, president of the u.s. biathlon association. “that is a stress-reducer.”  less stress, fewer colds. so the trick is to worry about colds just enough to enhance prevention without getting so worried that it leads to illness. the solution for the united states snowboarder meghan tierney is to not worry at all.  “this might sound weird, but i think the best way to prevent colds is to, like, not try to prevent them,” she said after a team news conference. “if you don’t think you’re going to get sick, you’re not going to get sick.”  this is a recently developed hunch. a week and a half ago, tierney was anxious about catching a cold right before the olympics and that is precisely what happened.        “i’m fine today, but because of that cold i now think i won’t get sick while i’m here.”  is that science talking, or you?  “it’s more me,” she said.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — olympics officials first learned about russia’s state-backed doping program — and how it had corrupted the results of several winter and summer games — in may 2016. now, only two days before the opening ceremony for the pyeongchang games, the eligibility of many russian athletes remains uncertain, creating confusion and mistrust across several sports.  forty-seven russian athletes who were barred for violating antidoping rules have filed appeals with the sports world’s highest appeals court to gain admission to the games, including 15 athletes and coaches who joined the case on wednesday. the court is expected to hold a hearing on those cases on thursday, the day preliminary competition begins at the olympics.  thursday afternoon, the court announced that an additional six athletes and seven coaches, doctors and support staff had filed appeals.  a final ruling on their eligibility may be made as late as friday morning here — hours before the opening ceremony. the athletes in limbo are cross country skiers and biathletes, bobsledders and speedskaters, hockey players and figure skaters. they include viktor ahn, a short-track speedskater who has won six olympic gold medals, and anton shipulin, a biathlon world champion.        “the timing there was not in our hands,” thomas bach, the president of the international olympic committee, said at a news conference wednesday. “studies had to be done, evidence had to be provided, fair hearings for the russian athletes had to be offered.”  after completing its own prolonged investigations that reiterated what had been known for more than a year, the i.o.c. in december barred russia’s olympic committee from the games and prohibited all insignia linked to the country. yet in an effort to avoid punishing athletes who did not cheat, the i.o.c. later cleared more than 160 athletes it determined to be clean to participate as “olympic athletes from russia.”  russia continues to deny the existence of a state-sponsored doping program.  the situation unfolding this week in south korea is reminiscent of two years ago, when russia also tried to use the court to restore athletes barred from the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro.  in rio, the i.o.c.’s leadership blamed the world anti-doping agency for causing chaos by releasing the results of its investigation into russia’s systematic doping plan so close to the start of the games. in pyeongchang on wednesday, bach blamed the court of arbitration for sport for causing confusion and uncertainty last week when it upheld an appeal by 28 russian athletes who had been barred, judging that the evidence against them was “insufficient to establish that an antidoping rule violation was committed by the athletes concerned.”        the 15 appeals filed wednesday were on behalf of 13 athletes and 2 coaches; they contend they should be allowed to participate after the court ruled last week there was insufficient evidence to link each of them to russia’s systematic cheating. olympic officials have argued that because they barred russia’s olympic committee, they are entitled to invite and exclude whichever russian athletes and coaches they choose.            image     international olympic committee president thomas bach at a news conference wednesday in pyeongchang.   credit  patrick semansky/associated press         the turmoil sparked a war of words within the i.o.c.’s usually clubby meeting room ahead of these games. richard pound of canada, the longest-serving i.o.c. member, warned his fellow members on tuesday that the organization was in trouble.  “i believe that in the collective mind of a significant portion of the world, and among the athletes of the world, the i.o.c. has not only failed to protect athletes, but has made it possible for cheating athletes to prevail against the clean athletes,” said pound, the former president of the world anti-doping agency.  “we talk more than we walk,” pound added. he said the athletes and the public “no longer have confidence that their interests are being protected. our commitment to both is in serious doubt. with respect, i don’t think we can talk our way out of this problem.”  pound’s intervention proved unpopular. he was berated by argentina’s gerardo werthein before all but two members — pound and adam pengilly of britain — voted in support of the i.o.c’s handling of the russian doping affair.  in his news conference after the two-day meeting, bach said members “cleared the air” and engaged in “lively debate.”  the organizers of the paralympics, which will take place here a few weeks after the olympics conclude, have continued their hard-line approach to russia. the country has been barred from next month’s paralympics. bach has taken a more conciliatory approach, favoring what he calls individual justice over collective punishment, despite describing russia’s actions as an “unprecedented attack on the integrity of the olympics.”        some of the group of 15 russians who filed appeals thursday are already in korea in anticipation of being permitted to compete.  this week, more than a dozen russian reporters, photographers and cameramen flocked to the yongpyong ski resort where the appeal hearings are being held. lawyers representing both sides said very little wednesday, leaving the court’s secretary general, matthieu reeb, to defend it in the face of criticism from bach and others.  “possibly a final decision can be rendered at the end of the day tomorrow,” reeb said. “if we need more time, perhaps it will be friday morning.”  bach tried to focus attention on what many consider to be a dramatic gesture of reconciliation, the fact athletes from north and south korea will march together in the opening ceremony and will field a joint women’s ice hockey team.  “it will be the moment, the most emotional moment,” bach said.

       " 'london — more than 40,000 runners will line up for the london marathon this weekend, but not a single athlete from russia will be in the professional field. the same was true for the boston marathon on monday, as well as nearly every track and field event for the past 30 months — the major ones like the olympic games, and minor ones, as well.  olympic officials renewed their embrace of russia after the winter games in pyeongchang, south korea, ruling that the country had served its sentence for conducting an elaborate doping program that corrupted several olympics. many governing bodies for individual sports have also eagerly tried to welcome back russian athletes into the competitions they oversee, but not track and field’s.  last week, track and field’s governing body announced that it had cleared nine russian athletes to compete in international competition as neutrals. they have been given a rare lifeline to carry on professionally while russia’s track and field program is suspended indefinitely for participating in a vast, state-backed doping program from 2010 until at least 2015 and failing to fulfill all the requirements for reinstatement.  the reprieve may end within a matter of weeks, however, amid continuing russian intransigence over acknowledging the scale of the scheme. such a move would represent a major escalation in the top summer olympic sport’s approach to the crisis, even as others have moved on.        the hard-line stance of track and field’s governing body, the international association of athletics federations, led by sebastian coe, has led to a stare-down with top russian officials who continue to deny that the doping program was state-sponsored. the governing body’s patience with russia is at a breaking point, according to people close to its leaders.  the stance has also caused a rift between coe and thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee. bach ended the i.o.c.’s ban on russia’s athletes after three months, almost immediately after the pyeongchang games, where a neutral team consisting of russian athletes was the third-largest contingent. track and field’s ban, which may soon become even more severe, has been in effect since 2015. both men have large egos and lengthy athletic résumés. their relationship, once close, has cooled over the russia issue; they have barely spoken in recent weeks.  officials on every side of the disagreement declined to speak publicly about it, citing the sensitive nature of negotiations over the matter.            image     sebastian coe, president of track and field’s governing body, has threatened to turn the indefinite suspension of russia’s athletes into a permanent one.   credit  dean lewins/epa, via shutterstock         the stalemate shows few signs of ending. the i.a.a.f. will not lift its ban until the world anti-doping agency declares russia in compliance with all of its regulations. wada will not do that unless russia acknowledges the dimensions of the scandal and allows access to a database at the moscow laboratory that was at the heart of much of the wrongdoing.        russia has shown few signs of ceding to either demand. in meetings, russian officials continue to deny the existence of the institutionalized doping plot now outlined in three independent reports, according to people involved in the talks. by denying access to the data stored at the laboratory, the russians are preventing officials from verifying information that may provide conclusive evidence.  a person with knowledge of the discussions said an admission of guilt was essential for convincing wada that russia would not violate doping rules in the future. “it’s not just about humiliating them,” he said.  the scale of russia’s doping scheme was revealed after grigory rodchenkov, the former head of its antidoping laboratory, became a whistle-blower. rodchenkov, now living in the united states, described an audacious plan that involved state security services and the large-scale swapping of drug-tainted urine samples for clean ones.  top track officials seethed when the international olympic committee lifted its ban on russia’s olympic committee, saying it weakened the leverage that the international sports federations had over russia in negotiations. russia will play host to soccer’s world cup this year.  craig reedie, wada’s president, told 900 delegates at its symposium last month in lausanne, switzerland, that russia had ignored four letters proposing a joint inspection of the laboratory in moscow where hundreds of samples are stored.  “the big losers here are russian athletes,” reedie said. “their participation in future events will continue to be put in doubt, and the rest of the world will not be convinced any meaningful change has taken place. real action is needed. it’s time for this situation to change. if not, it will damage sport — every russian victory will be doubted.”        russia has met most of the other requirements for readmission that wada demanded three years ago. russia’s antidoping agency has new leadership. it is once again testing athletes.            image        anna krylova of russia competed at the 2018 world indoor championships in birmingham, england, in march.   credit  ben stansall/agence france-presse — getty images         but the day before the symposium, dmitry shlyakhtin, the head of russia’s athletics federation, and pavel kolobkov, its sports minister, met with officials from an i.a.a.f task force for monitoring russian compliance. the group, led by the norwegian antidoping expert rune andersen, made clear that a threat in march to ban russia from the sport permanently was real.  “this severe step is possible if we will not be constantly proving that our athletes and coaches are observing antidoping regulations and rules of tournaments,” shlyakhtin recently told tass, russia’s state-controlled news agency.  the stakes are high for all sides. russia remains one of track and field’s powerhouse nations; only the united states and kenya have won more world championship medals. russia has also played a vital role in sponsoring and hosting track and field events, from junior competitions to the 2013 world championships.  an outright ban would completely rule out russians from competing on the international stage, confirming the country’s pariah status. it would also require russia to reapply for membership, which isn’t guaranteed and raises doubts about its team’s participation in the olympic games in tokyo, which are just two years away.  such a result would be hugely embarrassing for bach and the olympic committee. coe was one of the first people bach turned to when he looked to reform the i.o.c. after his elevation to president in 2013. but coe, who has led track’s governing body since 2015, has still not been invited to join the olympic committee even though he heads probably the most important sport in the summer olympics program.  in march, coe announced the possibility of doubling down on penalties against russia as he was facing his own crisis. the previous day, a british parliamentary committee accused coe of misleading the lawmakers’ investigation into a scheme by the i.a.a.f.’s previous leadership to extort russian athletes who had failed drug tests. people close to coe, who was vice president of the federation during the extortion scheme, said coe’s threat of a permanent ban on russia was not related to the parliamentary report that criticized him.        bach has long emphasized a preference for individual justice over collective punishment. he pushed the i.o.c. to clear 169 russian athletes to participate at the pyeongchang games, where they were allowed to wear uniforms bearing the word “russia.” by contrast, the i.a.a.f allowed only 19 to compete at the 2017 world championships. they were not identified as russians.  recent developments appear to vindicate the i.a.a.f.’s cautious approach to restoring russian membership. the austrian police, acting on a tip from wada,  raided the headquarters  of biathlon’s global governing body last week, linking its leaders with possible efforts to cover up russian doping.  before the i.a.a.f. meets to decide russia’s fate, officials will be paying close attention to developments at a crucial wada board meeting next month in montreal. russia will once again be the dominant agenda item, with a monitoring group expected to recommend retaining the suspension on russia’s antidoping agency.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the russian athlete who won a bronze medal in curling at the winter olympics has traveled to the south korean capital, seoul, to await the results of a second drug test and will depart the country should his failed test be confirmed.  alexander krushelnytsky’s failed preliminary doping test puts in jeopardy his medal and russia’s efforts to move past a vast state-backed cheating scheme that left it nominally barred from the games.  krushelnytsky competed in mixed doubles curling with his wife. he is the first athlete from russia to come under investigation for using a banned substance in pyeongchang.  traces of meldonium, a heart medicine that increases blood flow and has been banned from most sports since 2016, were found in a routine urine sample. a second test will be conducted to confirm the finding, according to a statement from an organization representing olympic athletes from russia, the designation given to more than 160 russian athletes who had been cleared to compete at the games under that name.        just one other athlete — the japanese short-track speedskater kei saito —  has failed a doping test at these games . he tested positive for the masking agent acetazolamide in an out-of-competition doping test on the day of his arrival.  representatives of olympic athletes from russia confirmed one of their athletes was under investigation, and an official with knowledge of the case but who was not authorized to publicly speak about it confirmed it was krushelnytsky.  the timing could not be worse for russia.  the nation was barred from the olympics in december after  an investigation into    a state-backed doping program that corrupted the 2014 olympics it hosted in sochi.  scores of athletes, coaches and officials tainted by the scandal have been barred, though the international olympic committee has been considering allowing the russian athletes to march under their national flag and in their country’s uniforms for the closing ceremony, which they were not permitted to do during the opening ceremony. the olympic anthem will be played instead of russia’s national anthem for any winners of gold medals, although no russians have won so far.  the failed test is likely to figure in the thinking of the three-person i.o.c. panel charged with deciding whether russia’s team could be reinstated for the closing ceremony and its athletes allowed to parade with the russian flag.        the panel is also closely monitoring the reaction from russian officials to the failed test. should they dispute the verdict or make critical comments it would be practically impossible to restore the russian team before the end of the games, said a person familiar with the group’s thinking. complicating matters further is russia’s continued failure to pay a $15 million fine levied by the i.o.c. as a response to the doping scheme. the fine is nonnegotiable.  the russians allowed to participate in south korea were subjected to what olympics officials described as a rigorous testing regimen, and have found themselves under scrutiny from testers as the event has progressed.  “on the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the antidoping system at the games, which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,” the international olympic committee said in a statement sunday.  meldonium caused confusion among russian athletes when it was added to the list of banned substances by the world anti-doping agency. scores of athletes, including the five-time grand slam tennis champion maria sharapova, tested positive for it.              the antidoping agency eventually ruled that more research was required to understand how long the substance, known as mildronate in russia, remained in the system, as some athletes claimed they had consumed it before the ban had come into force.  experts have said it is possible that trace amounts of the substance would still be detectable for a few months after an athlete stopped taking it, but it is unlikely it would still be present if an athlete stopped taking the drug before the ban went into effect in january 2016.        eastern european scientists have promoted meldonium’s health benefits, saying it increases blood flow. increased blood flow also provides more oxygen to muscles and could increase endurance. while curling is far from cross-country skiing in terms of exertion, curlers spend hours on their feet and vigorously sweep the ice at regular intervals.  many of the athletes involved, though not sharapova, eventually had their suspensions lifted because it was not clear when they had taken the substance.  krushelnytsky was part of the mixed doubles team that won a bronze medal last week, a rare bright spot for the depleted russian olympic squad, which has struggled without some of its top stars.  in the curling event, he appeared to do most of the pair’s sweeping. they defeated kristin skaslin and magnus nedregotten of norway in the bronze medal match, 8-4.  the russian team actually had a chance to win its semifinal against switzerland, but krushelnytsky overshot a target on his final shot of the match, and switzerland advanced to the final, where it was defeated by canada.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — shortly after 11 a.m. for the last several days, sung baik-yoo, the chief spokesman for the organizers of the 2018 winter olympics, has leaned into a microphone at a news conference and provided a ticket sales update. the news is always a little more positive than the day before.  by thursday, sung said organizers were within one percent of their target of 90 percent sold out, a figure that equals about one million tickets sold. yet the scene at venues here in pyeongchang, south korea, from the ski slopes in the mountain cluster to the ice sports stadiums of olympic park, tells a story far different from sung’s pronouncements of success.  swaths of empty blue seats have been a familiar backdrop despite organizers’ efforts to fill in gaps by providing volunteers with so-called passion tickets that allow them to attend events and by bringing in school groups by the busload.  so far, fans have been able to show up right before the start of all but the most popular events and buy a ticket.        peter skinner, an australian who traveled to the games from his home in bangkok, said he regretted purchasing tickets months before the games started.  “we’re never again buying tickets in advance,” said skinner, as he walked with his wife toward the hockey arena for the first session of the men’s competition. one event they had been looking forward to, the men’s downhill, was postponed along with several other skiing events because of bad weather. they headed to figure skating instead.            image     the biathlon did not appear to be a big draw at the pyeongchang games, as these empty seats at the alpine biathlon centre show.     credit  hilary swift for the new york times         “it’s sad, it’s half empty,” he said of the sparse attendance he had seen.  it is not just the spectators who have noticed. aksel lund svindal of norway described completing his gold medal run in the men’s downhill on thursday in front of a mostly empty grandstand as “a little bit strange.”  the low attendance may be partly attributed to the fact that south korea does not have a culture of alpine sports. it has achieved winter olympic success in just two events, speedskating and figure skating.        at some games in other countries, locals have packed venues to watch unfamiliar sports just to be a part of the experience. that has not happened here. a near-capacity crowd watched the short-track speedskater lim hyo-jun secure south korea’s first gold medal on saturday, but less popular events are taking place in front of blocks of empty seats.  “if we had this race in italy, austria, norway, sweden, it would be packed with 50,000 people,” svindal said. to be fair, he said, he doubted people in norway would fill an arena for short-track speedskating, like they did here, but he still wished he had won his medal amid a more raucous atmosphere. “it’s a bit sad.”  empty seats are not a problem unique to the pyeongchang games. organizers of the last two olympics — in rio de janeiro in 2016 and sochi two years earlier — also found themselves under scrutiny as images of half-empty venues were beamed worldwide.  unused seats reserved for sponsors and athletes were blamed then. organizers are doing the same here. “we find they are the empty seats,” said a spokeswoman for pyeongchang 2018, though it is unlikely that is the lone explanation. organizers continue to advertise the games and are actively encouraging fans to buy tickets on-site.            image        athletes are noticing the empty seats, such as these at the jeongseon alpine centre, and puzzling over it.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         heightened political tension between north korea and the united states in the buildup to the games did not help sales. less than six months before the games opened, president trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on north korea in response to a spate of missile tests by the north. the heavily armed border separating the koreas  is about 40 miles    from the olympic park .  occasional ticketing and transportation mix-ups have also caused venues to fill up only after events in them have started.        a women’s hockey game on wednesday between a joint korean team and japan was well into the first period when one ticketholder, jewell hatton from pennsylvania, said an attendant stopped her and told her that her ticket was invalid. organizers had reassigned her seat, and new arrangements would have to be made.  “that happened last night, too,” hatton said.  organizers said some tickets had to be reissued because of additional space required by broadcasters.  groups of south korean schoolchildren have been a common sight, bused in for field trips as part of a program by the ministry of education to educate young koreans about winter sports.  they also fill empty seats quite nicely. at a recent hockey game, a group of schoolchildren hungrily snapped photographs of the all-women cheerleading troupe from north korea.  a program is also in place for olympic volunteers to take up unoccupied seats. they are required to remove their uniforms so they are not identifiable, and they are obligated to move should a paying spectator show up.  “we also hope that this will help to increase the stadium’s atmosphere, so that athletes can perform their best,” a spokesman for pyeongchang 2018 said.        some foreign fans who have found limited transportation options are also rethinking whether to attend late-night sessions. organizers run buses to central hubs, but after that, fans are largely on their own amid the freezing temperatures.  “i’ve had to call the guy who owns the hotel near where we are staying to come and pick me up,” said skinner, the australian from bangkok. he said he had seen other spectators ask volunteers — and even police officers — for rides.  he is staying about three miles from the venues — close compared with some fans. but, he added, “it’s a long way to walk when it’s minus 15.”  at least one athlete saw the relative quiet as a silver lining. laura dahlmeier, a german biathlete, said that she needs to be able to concentrate as she fires her rifle at the target.  “i prefer this to when 50,000 people are screaming,” she said.

       " 'global antidoping authorities have begun assessing the cases of individual athletes implicated in russia’s yearslong doping program that was exposed last year, and their early decisions are expected to fuel the debate over russian athletes’ eligibility.  the world anti-doping agency, the regulator of drugs in sports that produced mountainous evidence of russia’s doping scheme, has agreed to clear 95 of the first 96 athletes whose cases have been reviewed, according to an internal report circulated among the organization’s executives in recent days.  the closed cases are very likely to set off a debate in the sports world over whether russia’s schemes were so successful in destroying evidence that defensible cases cannot be built against some athletes, or whether officials have taken a soft approach to punishments.        “the available evidence was insufficient to support the assertion of an antidoping rule violation against these 95 athletes,” olivier niggli, the agency’s director general, wrote in the internal report, which was obtained by the new york times. the report does not identify any of the 96 athletes.            world anti-doping agency report on russian doping  in an internal report obtained by the new york times, the antidoping regulator agreed to close 95 of the 96 investigations into russian athletes that have been resolved so far.       in an interview on monday, mr. niggli said: “the system was very well organized,” referring to russia’s coordinated cheating that extended from world championship competitions to the olympic games. “on top if it, years after the fact, the remaining evidence is often very limited.”  richard mclaren, the investigator who spent much of the last two years deconstructing russia’s schemes and identifying about 1,000 implicated athletes, indicated that many cases would be hard to prosecute given russia’s lack of cooperation in providing lab data, and its practice of  destroying  tainted urine samples that would be plainly incriminating.  still, sports officials charged with building cases against the 95 athletes in question appear to have never followed up on certain leads. most notably, none requested interviews with the whistle-blower dr. grigory rodchenkov — russia’s former antidoping lab chief now living in the united states, whose  tell-all account  prompted mr. mclaren’s inquiry report — raising questions about their willingness to discipline a major sports power.  in a letter obtained by the times, dr. rodchenkov’s lawyer wrote to the antidoping regulator on sunday taking issue with the fact that sports officials had not solicited his client’s testimony and had claimed that dr. rodchenkov was unavailable. for more than a year, he has been living in hiding in the united states under protection from the justice department, which has  investigated  russia’s systematic doping in american sports competitions.        “dr. rodchenkov’s alleged unavailability has been cited as one of the reasons for the closure of the investigations of individual athletes,” jim walden, the lawyer, wrote. “dr. rodchenkov has been willing to cooperate,” he continued, noting that only an olympic investigator, and no sport-specific officials, had requested an interview.            image     craig reedie, right, president of the world anti-doping agency, and olivier niggli, the agency’s director general. “the system was very well organized,” mr. niggli said about russia’s doping program.   credit  fabrice coffrini/agence france-presse — getty images         once mr. mclaren’s reports described russia’s doping program, the sanctioning of individual athletes fell into the global sports bureaucracy. the governing bodies for each sport were left to scrutinize their own athletes and mete out punishment when warranted. the world anti-doping agency would then review the decisions made by various sports federations and determine whether they should be approved or challenged. that process has yielded the 95 cases that the antidoping agency has agreed to close.  some antidoping officials have expressed concern about conflicts of interest among the leaders of individual sports, because they might be inclined to exonerate their own athletes. the head of the global antidoping agency, craig reedie, is also a member of the international olympic committee,  prompting questions  about his dual roles of promoting the olympic brand while also pursuing offenses that could tarnish it.  each sport’s governing body and the international olympic committee have ultimate authority over sanctioning athletes, but the antidoping regulator’s declarations are influential, and the agency has the power to appeal cases.  mr. niggli stressed that investigations into other athletes implicated in the doping system were continuing, and that officials needed to pursue the strongest cases first so that they would stand up against the inevitable legal challenges in world sport’s arbitration court. “leading with a weak case or a poorly prepared case could negatively affect the outcome of all other cases,” the internal report said.  “we have to accept the fact that mclaren’s purpose was to prove a system, not individual violations,” mr. niggli said in the telephone interview. “there might have been more evidence out there in russia for sure, but there was a limit to what he was able to get.”            image        dr. grigory rodchenkov, russia’s former antidoping lab chief, is the whistle-blower who prompted an inquiry into russia’s doping scheme.   credit  emily berl for the new york times         the regulator’s exoneration of 95 athletes will most likely be seen as partial vindication by russia, whose officials have been alternately defiant and conciliatory while consistently  disputing  that the state played any role in the cheating. reaction will also most likely be closely watched by the international olympic committee, which is continuing its investigations into russia’s cheating and considering blanket punishments for the nation ahead of the 2018 games.  while the i.o.c. has  opened disciplinary proceedings  against dozens of russian olympians, no medals from the 2014 games in sochi, russia — where the nation cheated most flagrantly, with dr. rodchenkov swapping out steroid-laced urine overnight — have been rescinded.  nine months ago, the antidoping regulator, which had lobbied to bar russia from the 2016 olympics,  published  1,166 pieces of evidence of russia’s schemes, unearthed by mr. mclaren and drawing on the testimony and computer hard drive of dr. rodchenkov.  although that evidence — including emails, documents and forensic and scientific analysis — effectively proved a doping system, mr. niggli said, it did not necessarily translate to prosecuting the athletes mr. mclaren had identified as having benefited from the program.  of the 96 cases closed so far, the athlete who has been disciplined, according to the internal report, was prosecuted successfully because officials had recovered an incriminating urine sample from dr. rodchenkov’s former laboratory in moscow. thousands of other such samples were destroyed, dr. rodchenkov said, and the russian government has made it a crime for investigators to enter a certain storage area in the lab containing other samples.  “the different types of evidence provided with respect to any individual athlete are like strands in a cable,” mr. mclaren wrote in his report last december. it would be up to the sports authorities, he said, “to determine whether the provided strands of evidence, standing alone or together, build a sufficiently strong cable.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the international olympic committee has upheld its suspension of russia as a team from the games, a move that will force the country’s athletes to march in the closing ceremony without their national colors or flag.  the decision, in a unanimous vote here sunday, came after two failed drug tests by russian athletes — among nearly 170 competing here under a special dispensation — and after a long night of talks among senior i.o.c. officials.  russia’s olympic committee was banned in december after revelations of one of the most sophisticated doping programs in sports history, including an elaborate scheme at the 2014 sochi games in russia. the i.o.c. will consider reinstating the russian committee if all remaining drug tests for its athletes at the pyeongchang games come back clean.  nicole hoevertsz, the leader of the i.o.c.’s panel reviewing russia’s compliance, said russia could be reinstated within the next week.        the i.o.c. decision came after protracted discussion over two days.  “we should draw a line, we have to draw a line and look to the future,” hoevertsz said.  russia’s final doping test results are anticipated within 72 hours, and if they are clean, the country will be restored to the i.o.c. in early march, hoevertsz said.  with the vote, the i.o.c.’s membership rubber-stamped a recommendation from its executive board. that group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on saturday.  the bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late saturday. the report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the russian olympic committee.  two investigations revealed that russia’s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years. many of russia’s top athletes were linked to the scandal and barred from the games.         alina zagitova , a 15-year-old figure skater, was the only russian to have won a gold medal in pyeongchang by the time the committee voted. the men’s hockey team won a second gold on sunday, defeating germany.  the russians will now leave the olympics the way they entered: in neutral uniforms that provided a constant reminder of the damage done to russia’s sporting reputation by the scheme, a state-controlled effort to replace drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones, according to the investigations.  president vladimir v. putin of russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.  the effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. before the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro, where russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. it made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these winter olympics. both attempts were unsuccessful.  a russian delegation that included evgenia medvedeva, the silver medalist in women’s figure skating, made a presentation to the executive board.  the bobsledder nadezhda sergeeva’s  positive drug test  the day before did not help russia’s cause. she was the second russian to fail a drug test here. when the i.o.c. banned russia on dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country’s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.  “this is not a decision everyone will be happy with,” hoevertsz said after sunday’s vote. “we will be criticized.”        the decision to potentially reinstate russia met skepticism on sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 summer olympics. in those tests, russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both games, according to the i.o.c.’s own statistics (18 out of 65 from beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from london 2012)  “if the retests shows the result then the i.o.c will take the appropriate measures,” bach said at a news conference sunday afternoon, without elaborating.  richard pound, the i.o.c.’s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of russia. adam pengilly, a british member who also has been critical of the i.o.c.’s reaction to the russia scandal, was sent home from the games after an altercation with a security guard.  after being warned that their conduct would affect the i.o.c.’s decision, russian athletes have largely been keeping a low profile in south korea. they have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols.  the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said. russia’s i.o.c. member, shamil tarpischev, said “a lack of cultural education” was to blame.  russia will be welcomed back as a full-fledged olympic nation if all of its remaining drugs tests from the pyeongchang games are negative. then the i.o.c. can try to move on from one of the biggest scandals in olympics history.  athletes from around the world have been among the most critical voices opposing russia’s return. on saturday, american biathletes joined others to say they wouldn’t participate in a season-ending event in russia.  “we believe this should be the end of this big problem and pave the way for a new chapter in olympic sport,” tarpischev said.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — five days after chicago lost the bid to host the 2016 summer olympics, finishing dead last in the voting, stephanie streeter stepped down from her role as the acting chief executive of the united states olympic committee. it showed that there was some accountability for an embarrassing failure and that someone needed to — and did — take the fall for a very public stumble.  in comparison, what do we have in light of the sexual abuse of 250-plus gymnasts at the hands of dr. lawrence g. nassar, a former member of the u.s.o.c.’s national medical network advisory board?  the opposite of accountability.  it’s the u.s.o.c. board members praising scott blackmun, the olympic committee’s chief executive, at a news conference in pyeongchang on friday for serving the organization “with distinction” and for doing “a phenomenal job,” even though the nassar scandal unfolded under his watch.  it’s larry probst, chairman of the committee’s board, apologizing to nassar’s victims but also saying, hey, the u.s.o.c. hasn’t come out of this scandal unscathed because “there has been a tremendous amount of criticism.”        probst said that blackmun would be keeping his job — for which he was paid $1 million in 2016 — until the u.s.o.c. has reason for him to leave. the organization has ordered an independent investigation of its actions in the nassar matter.  (blackmun is not in pyeongchang because he is recovering from surgery to treat prostate cancer).  it’s not enough that the u.s.o.c. was told by u.s.a. gymnastics in 2015, according to report in the wall street journal, that gymnasts had accused nassar of sexual misconduct and that the u.s.o.c. did nothing to intervene —  a fact highlighted by the wall street journal.   and it’s not enough that senators jeanne shaheen, democrat of new hampshire, and joni ernst, republican of iowa, called last week for blackmun’s removal. or that more and more calls for blackmun’s head are coming in by the day. those demands make complete sense when the u.s.o.c.’s weak oversight of olympic sports’ national governing bodies very likely helped a predator like nassar thrive.  on thursday, senator dianne feinstein, a california democrat who sponsored a bill that made it mandatory for olympic governing bodies to report sexual abuse to the police, also called for blackmun’s resignation.  “if mr. blackmun did nothing for a year after learning about the allegations of widespread sexual abuse, then he should step down,” ms. feinstein said, through a spokeswoman, in response to emailed questions. “there can be zero tolerance for turning a blind eye to sexual abuse of minors.”        both senators from colorado, senator michael bennet, a democrat, and senator cory gardner, a republican — said through their representatives that anyone who knew about the nassar accusations and did nothing must step down. the u.s.o.c. is based in colorado.  probst said on friday that blackmun had acted just as he was supposed to after learning of the accusations against nassar.  but the call for blackmun’s ouster shouldn’t be just about the u.s.o.c.’s role in the nassar matter. because it’s certainly not the only sexual abuse scandal that has unfolded under blackmun’s watch.  to his credit, blackmun spearheaded the efforts to create the denver-based u.s. center for safesport, a national nonprofit organization providing education and resources, including a hotline, to promote respect and prevent abuse in sport. it took seven years.  other sports, like swimming, taekwondo and judo, have had major abuse problems, and blackmun was introduced to some of them soon after he took over as chief executive in 2010. right away, he should have recognized that the u.s.o.c. needed to oversee the federations with a sharper eye and make it a priority to address abuse. he should have seen that it was the u.s.o.c.’s duty to keep all athletes safe.  in 2010, three months after blackmun was hired, u.s.a. swimming came under fire for mishandling dozens of sexual abuse cases. that year, the swimming organization set up a program to investigate sexual abuse accusations within its own sport. but letting a federation investigate itself is never a good idea, and the abuse continued.  in 2016, u.s.a. taekwondo told the u.s.o.c. that it had been investigating sexual assault accusations involving two of its biggest olympic stars. but after consulting with the u.s.o.c., the taekwondo federation  put the investigation on hold  for the rio olympics, and those athletes competed at the games, according to usa today.        at the rio olympics, blackmun addressed revelations in the indianapolis star that u.s.a. gymnastics had kept files of more than 50 complaints of sexual abuse of athletes, but failed to report them to law enforcement.  he called the u.s.o.c.’s policy regarding sexual abuse “state of the art,” even though the u.s. center for safesport — whose charge was to investigate sexual abuse and other misconduct cases — hadn’t yet opened.  “we became more focused on this issue in 2010,” blackmun said.  the safesport center started fielding calls in 2017. that’s seven years of abuse cases in olympic sports, and seven years of the u.s.o.c. letting national federations investigate their own abuse cases.  that slow pace is a slap in the face to athletes. it showed that blackmun’s priority wasn’t to protect athletes. it took 200-plus abuse cases of girls and women in gymnastics for him to finally open his eyes.  blackmun and the u.s.o.c. couldn’t have missed the glaring fact that national federations shouldn’t be left to investigate themselves, no matter the issue. the federations’ goal is to market and promote their sports, so they can’t be trusted. it’s why the united states anti-doping agency was formed to handle drug testing and drug cases. when the federations were in charge of policing themselves, athletes often seemed to get away with cheating.  yet blackmun is more than hanging on: the u.s.o.c. is applauding him. what message does that send to the hundreds of athletes who have been abused since he took over as chief executive?  a terrible one.  so when considering whether blackmun should stay or go, remember what he said in rio regarding that initial report of abuse in gymnastics:  “we have to think, first and foremost, of the athlete.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — the first time that “olympiakos ymnos,” or the olympic hymn, was played in front of a large audience, in athens in 1896, the greek composer spyridon samaras conducted a massive orchestra and a large choir in a performance of the song he had written.  “when the trumpet gave the signal and samaras, a chubby fellow, lifted his baton,” another greek composer recalled, “the olympic hymn with those grandiose chords vibrated the national string in the souls of the myriad spectators who have filled the stadium and with national pride clapped maniacally the resurgence of the ancient olympic games.”  the song has not stirred such passion since. and it probably will not do so when it is used as an audible stand-in for the russian national anthem at the pyeongchang olympics in south korea. it might just stir confusion.  the russians,  caught in a doping scandal , were stripped of key identifying markers at these winter games, such as their national uniforms and their flag. and their anthem.        so when a russian athlete wins a gold medal — that will probably happen for the first time at the pyeongchang games in women’s figure skating — the olympic flag of five interlocking rings will be raised to the rafters to the mostly unfamiliar strains of  samaras’s olympic hymn.   “it’s not a bad piece of music,” said william guegold, a retired music professor from the university of akron and the author of “100 years of olympic music,” published in 1996. “it’s just not something that has wide public appeal to it or would be a popular piece in any way.”  a faithful few might recognize it as the official anthem, or hymn, of the olympics. it is traditionally played at the opening and closing ceremonies, and is somewhat forgettable.  the women’s figure skating final is friday here; thursday night on the east coast. the russian skaters alina zagitova, 15, and evgenia medvedeva, 18, are the consensus choices to win gold and silver. whenever the olympic hymn is played, for one of them or any other athlete from russia, it will not be the first time that the song was used in place of a national anthem.        in 1992, for example,  gold medal winners from the unified team , consisting of athletes from the recently fractured soviet union, were feted with the olympic hymn. they watched as the olympic flag was raised to the rafters to the sound of a little-known greek composer’s song, sapping the usual emotion from the proceedings.        image     spyridon samaras, born in 1861, was a greek composer mostly known for his operas. the international olympic committee adopted his olympic hymn as the official anthem ahead of the 1960 summer games in rome, more than 40 years after his death, in 1917.      that, apparently, is the point of banning the russian anthem — to take away a bit of the national pride in the accomplishment of winning a gold medal.  the unintended consequence: more samaras.  born in 1861, samaras was greece’s most famous composer when the ancient idea of the olympics was rebooted in athens in 1896. he had moved to paris, then to italy, where he built a reputation for operas in the style of a contemporary, giacomo puccini.  samaras accepted an offer to write a hymn for the olympics, certainly unaware it would be the most lasting part of his legacy. (one measure? spotify’s library includes one song from samaras: olympic hymn.)  “these were the reconstituted games by pierre de coubertin, designed to be competitions of the body, mind and spirit — this uplifting, greek, heroic ideal,” guegold said. “so they wanted a piece that exhibited that.”  what the olympics got was a romantic, accessible piece, with lots of brass and drums, and a softer middle section wrapped around a poem written by  kostis palamas , another greek, and dripping in schmaltzy grandeur.  the style set the tone for future olympic songs, including  “bugler’s dream,”  by leo arnaud, known widely to american television audiences, and john williams’s  “olympic fanfare and theme,”  from the 1984 los angeles games. (those two, sometimes clumsily stitched together, are still used on nbc’s olympic telecasts.)        “the beginning is very much a fanfare,” guegold said. “the trumpets blowing the call, getting everybody to come together. it has that sort of rhythmic quality, musical triplets and fanfare devices.”  the middle section of praises is sung by choirs, including the  mormon tabernacle choir for the 2002 salt lake winter olympics , often with palamas’s words translated into the local language. in 1988, at the summer games in seoul, south korea, they were sung in korean.  “then the end has a nice big splash again,” guegold said. “it grows, gets louder, and has a strong finish to it in terms of its grandeur.”  some renditions last about four minutes. shortened versions, usually little more than a minute, are used when called upon for medal ceremonies.  samaras’s most famous composition nearly died in obscurity, resurrected only after decades in a coma. (he placed it in a 1908 opera of his as an overture, but that did not do much to add to its popularity at the time.) after athens, subsequent olympic host cities sometimes commissioned their own songs, a string of one-hit wonders.            image     the olympic flag was raised during the playing of the olympic hymn at the opening ceremony of the 2004 summer games, which were held in athens.   credit  adrian dennis/agence france-presse — getty images         it was not until  richard strauss composed a piece for the 1936 summer games in berlin  that the international olympic committee became smitten with the idea of a single, official anthem. it granted the status to strauss’s hymn.        it did not last. world war ii came and the olympics were suspended until 1948, when they were held in london. england was not about to play a german song as an official olympic anthem. (germany, along with japan, was not invited to participate.) the english found their own hymn, as the finns did for the 1952 summer games in helsinki.  the olympic committee still wanted a permanent hymn.  a contest was created  in 1954, giving candidates less than a year to create a full orchestral score (vocal optional) of three to four minutes. a jury would select the winner.  there were 392 entries. the winner was “an ultramodern atonal work,” according to the historical dictionary of the olympic movement, that was submitted by a polish composer named michael spisak. as with the work of samaras and strauss, spisak’s song did not last more than one olympic cycle.  “it was never terribly popular,” the authors of the olympic dictionary wrote, “and spisak’s demands for excessive royalties resulted in it not being chosen as the official olympic anthem.”  in a  history of the anthem  written for the international society of olympic historians, philip barker noted the lingering desire for a singular anthem.  “in the highly politicized cold war atmosphere of the 1950s, the olympic anthem was often suggested as a way of defusing excessive nationalism,” barker wrote.  a greek member of the olympic committee saw an opportunity to rekindle interest in samaras’s original score. he nudged a japanese counterpart before committee meetings in tokyo in 1958, and an orchestra played the song from 1896. members hastily adopted it as the official anthem in time for the 1960 summer olympics in rome, and it has remained that way since.        samaras never knew. he died in 1917.  host countries still like to add their own songs to the mix at the opening and closing ceremonies (that’s where williams’s olympic song came from, in 1984) but with little lasting effect beyond a footnote to sports history. only one song, besides the national anthems — and, in this case, in place of a national anthem — is heard at every olympics.  “the olympics is an organization that likes tradition,” guegold said. “once they set something in motion and it settles in, it lasts. i don’t foresee a time where they say, ‘o.k., now we need something different.’ i think we’re going to have it for quite a long time.”  that might be music to the ears of greeks, though there are only a few of them competing in south korea. mostly, depending on the athletic success of the russians, it could be music — vaguely familiar, sometimes out of time and place — to the ears of everyone else.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — russia failed in an 11th hour attempt to overturn a ban against 47 athletes and coaches from participating at the 2018 winter games on friday, saving the international olympic committee from welcoming individuals it had judged to be tainted by the most elaborate doping program in sports history.  the decision, delivered by the secretary general of the court of arbitration for sport at a packed news conference, just hours before the opening ceremony, allowed the i.o.c. a reprieve from the legal disputes and welter of criticism linked to the russia’s doping scandal.  the court essentially ruled that the i.o.c. had the right to decide which russian athletes it could invite because it had already banned the country’s olympic committee in december for its yearslong doping program that had corrupted several winter and summer games.  russia has continued to deny that it operated the doping program, whose tentacles reached to the highest levels of russian sport, according to investigators. the panel agreed.        “this panel is faced with evaluating an unprecedented response to an extraordinary situation, that is, a state-sponsored doping scheme,” the panel said.  matthieu reeb, the court’s secretary general, said the applicants did not demonstrate that the manner of two special commissions established to determine eligibility for the games was carried out “in a discriminatory, arbitrary or unfair manner.”  russia’s deputy prime minister vitaly mutko, who is serving a life ban from the olympics for his role in the scandal, said: “this decision could not have been different. the inviting formula is extremely difficult to challenge, regardless of whether violations existed. the procedure itself is not transparent and does not contribute to the authority of the organization in the fans’ opinion.”  he compared the invitation process to a “commercial private club tournament,” adding, “this all will diminish competition and attention to the games.”  victory for the russian contingent, which included viktor ahn, a short-track speedskater who has won six olympic gold medals, and anton shipulin, a biathlon world champion, would have damaged the credibility of i.o.c. president thomas bach. critics have accused bach of trying too hard to avoid alienating russia, which has been one of the most supportive and successful countries in international sports, at the expense of punishing the country for instituting the elaborate cheating scheme.        just days earlier bach had railed against the sports court for upholding the appeals of 28 russian athletes who an i.o.c. panel had said breached antidoping regulations at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia. that reversal paved the way for 15 individuals to join a claim by 32 others to be allowed to appear in pyeongchang.  after completing its own prolonged investigations that reiterated what an independent investigation revealed in 2016, the i.o.c. banned russian officials and athletes linked to the doping program but said it would allow individuals it deemed “clean” to participate as “olympic athletes from russia.” that group of almost 170 athletes is one of the largest contingents at pyeongchang.  “the fact the i.o.c. chose not to issue a blanket ban was a consequence of its efforts to reward clean athletes,” said stephen hess, chairman of the appeals tribunal for the international bobsled and skeleton federation.  tensions have been running high over the participation of the russian team. many athletes have expressed concerns about the possibility of competing against individuals linked to the clandestine doping scheme that involved the large scale swapping of drug tainted urine samples for clean ones. lowell bailey, an american biathlete and a reigning world champion, this week blamed the i.o.c. for creating uncertainty so close to the games. “i think that the timing of all this is ridiculous,” he said.  the i.o.c. didn’t elaborate on the verdict friday, issuing a 16-word statement shortly after it had been announced.  “we welcome this decision, which supports the fight against doping and brings clarity for all athletes,” it said.  in recent days, russian officials here had expressed confidence the court would rule in their favor.        “today is a great and historic day for russian sport: we can finally win in this story of doping,” a russian television journalist said in a live broadcast, standing just yards from the room where legal arguments were taking place thursday.  russia’s english language broadcaster rt took to twitter to post a video of an enormous russian flag beamed onto the front of building close to the canadian headquarters of the world anti doping agency. a slogan read: the russians are coming.  after making the announcement on behalf of the court, reeb had to be spirited away into a side room as russian journalists demanded to know why the three-person arbitration panel sided with the i.o.c.  “they didn’t make any violations of the antidoping rules. why are they not let into the olympic games?” one television reporter demanded to know. reeb smiled wanly before saying he couldn’t answer questions.  the case against russia was largely built on the testimony of the former head of its drug testing laboratory, grigory rodchenkov. rodchenkov, now living in hiding in the united states, detailed how he had formulated cocktails of banned substances to athletes and swapped the tainted samples under the direction of government officials. russia has branded him a traitor and issued an arrest warrant against him.  “i am confident that today’s decision is mostly a reaction to the outcry from clean athletes against olympic corruption and complicity,” rodchenkov’s lawyer jim walden said in a statement. “i hope i.o.c. president thomas bach is listening.”  the strain of the doping scandal was evident earlier this week at a meeting of the i.o.c.’s membership, when the usual chummy atmosphere briefly descended into accusations and recriminations when its longest-serving member, canada’s richard pound, said the organization was in trouble.        “i don’t think we can talk our way out of this problem,” pound said.  gerardo werthein, a member from argentina, lashed back at pound for being overly critical and discrediting the i.o.c.  officials are hoping that the focus will switch from doping to sports now that the final appeals by the russians are over.  “we want this relegated to page 17 of the newspapers when the sport starts — not on the front or back,” the world antidoping agency president craig reedie said.

       " 'the sprinter  justin gatlin  is a tailor-made stand-in for the doping ills of track and field.  he served a four-year suspension after testing positive for steroids. he came back and continues to run fiercely in his 35th year, laying down the fastest times ever for a runner his age. last weekend, in london, he spoiled the retirement run of the great olympic champion usain bolt, whom some writers revere as the symbol of a clean sport. gatlin ran 9.92 seconds in the 100 meters on saturday night at the world championships, and took the gold medal.  bolt settled for the bronze .  fans showered gatlin with boos; british sportswriters waxed righteous about their pantomime villain (“gatlin is a shameless fraud” was one of the milder takes); and sebastian coe, president of track and field’s international governing body, was beside himself for having to award a medal to gatlin.  “i’m not eulogistic at the thought of somebody who has served two bans in our sport walking off with one of the biggest prizes,” coe said.  this narrative is fractured and self-righteous. gatlin has sinned, but the outrage, particularly from those who know better, edges toward the absurd.        let’s start with what is, by now, the standard indictment: gatlin is a  “two-time drug cheat,”  with “unrepentant” added as the adjectival chaser.  this is inaccurate. his first offense was no offense at all.  in the summer of 2001, after his freshman year at the university of tennessee, gatlin tested positive for a very small trace of amphetamine after running as an amateur in an event sponsored by usa track &amp; field. amphetamines are ingredients in adderall, for which gatlin has carried a prescription since he was 7 years old and learned he had an attention deficit disorder. he took adderall while preparing for summer midterms three days before the race.            image     bolt, left, thumped his chest while winning the 100 meters at the rio games in 2016. gatlin, right, in lane 4, finished second.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         his decision was consistent with n.c.a.a. rules and guidance given to professional athletes. nonetheless, coe’s organization, the international association of athletics federations, handed down a two-year ban. gatlin appealed and got the suspension cut to a year. the grand executioners in the press corps might want to page to the decision’s conclusion:  “mr. gatlin neither cheated nor intended to cheat,” the appeals panel wrote. “he is certainly not a doper.”  so gatlin is a one-time doper. in 2006, he tested positive for a steroid and was suspended for eight years, a sentence  reduced to four years after he cooperated  with federal investigators. he would lose four peak years and millions of dollars in earnings, a considerably tougher penalty than those meted out to athletes in pro baseball, basketball or football. (world soccer has adopted the olympic code and consequently levies tough penalties.)        that seems a suitably stiff sentence for a first offense.  let me now back off a step or three and interrogate my own righteousness.  a month ago, i talked with the american high jumper chaunté lowe about the moment last november when she learned she had won a bronze medal in the 2008 olympics. the international antidoping agency, taking advantage of technological advances, retested the blood of three jumpers (two russians and a ukrainian) who finished ahead of her at those games. it disqualified all three. lowe learned of this by facebook and felt caught between elation and sorrow, aware of opportunities lost, not least that joyous moment atop a podium.  a year ago, i sat atop a mountain outside oslo and heard two top american biathletes, susan dunklee and lowell bailey, talk about the frustration of competing to their lung-straining best and suspecting that some of the athletes a few paces ahead of them might have a chemical advantage.  these athletes work too hard to think we can just slap them on the back and murmur que será, será. they enjoy precious few years at their peak. several of them told me they would like to see career suspensions for first doping offenses.            image        bolt won the 100 meters at the london games in 2012. gatlin, right, was third.   credit  jed jacobsohn for the new york times         there is, too, the peculiar challenge presented when nations or olympic committees cover their eyes, with all the advantages and subterfuge that implies. the united states olympic committee, for many years in the 1980s, enabled a pervasive doping problem. its  leaders knew  that american swimmers, runners and jumpers were doping with the complicity of top olympic coaches.  the united states has cracked down hard. but russia has taken on the mantle and gone far beyond, running a state-sponsored doping program with a thuggish insistence that gives its athletes and coaches little choice. this represents an existential threat to clean sport.        i called max cobb, the president of u.s. biathlon and an insistent reformer, and asked about the question of appropriate penalties for athletes like gatlin. he is not by temperament the sort who favors blanket lifetime suspensions, and he sees considerable mitigating factors in gatlin’s case. he also sees a place for lifetime bans as a threat.  “if you are engaged in systematic blood manipulation, you are deliberately trying to cheat the system,” cobb noted. “it cannot be an accident, and that’s where the option of a lifetime ban would really help.”  track and field’s reputation as irreparably tarnished by doping may be unfair and owe paradoxically to its growing ability to ferret out offenders. the doping era may have reached its body-distorting peak before the turn of this century, when athletes from many nations imbibed all sorts of steroids. olympians break records with less regularity now; some women’s records set in that period have stood for decades. scientists speculate that cheating athletes now take smaller doses to avoid detection.  as for bolt and gatlin, too many reporters and fans remain invested in fairy-tale dichotomies. bolt is a glorious runner and a joyous showman for the ages, and he has passed every drug test without a glitch. so writers fit him for a crown as the king of clean sport.            image        galtin took a victory lap with the american flag after winning the 100 meters at the athens games in 2004.   credit  vincent laforet/the new york times         what, however, explains the urgency in fitting gatlin for the crown of thorns? gatlin is an athlete of his time and place. he finished third in the 100 meters at the 2012 london olympics. five of the eight men who ran that day have served doping bans. there were runners in london last weekend who had served doping suspensions and returned to competition.  track and field offers a complicated world.  coe’s rhetoric is steely, and he has accomplished some good since becoming chief of the international federation. he was also forced to acknowledge in 2015 that nike had paid him $150,000 annually to serve as a company “ambassador.” french prosecutors are examining whether anyone bribed top international track officials to steer the 2021 world championships to eugene, ore.        shadows, too, have fallen across the sporting goods companies, which wield great influence over the sport. nike, its pre-eminent power, runs a top track program out of its facilities in oregon, and its coach alberto salazar has faced  repeated reports  suggesting his approach is  tainted by chemicals .  my intention here is not to throw up a cloud and allow gatlin to slip untouched off the stage. his athletic history is a cross of his making. after a four-year absence, he returned overweight and slow, turning in embarrassing times in places like finland.  he found a new coach, who had himself once tested positive, and dismantled and reworked his form. he began to explode out of the blocks with surgical precision. by 2015, he was laying down eyebrow-raising times, peaking at 9.74. that led even sober analysts like ross tucker, whose website science of sport is much respected, to  wonder aloud  if he was doping again, or had ever stopped.  that moment likely has passed.  the championship race in london was an old man’s affair. gatlin won with a 9.92. had he run that time at the world championships in beijing in 2015, he would have finished far behind bolt. he is tested randomly by the united states anti-doping agency; screeners checked his blood four times and his urine 10 times last year before the olympics.  he passed all of those.  age is the runner that will track gatlin to earth. when i saw him in oregon in may, he acknowledged mental fatigue and hamstrings and thighs that growl like old hounds.  he is a personable man; he is flawed. there’s no need to turn him into a hero. but the villain stuff plays like the cheap tricks adults use to distract from bigger problems.

       " 'president trump’s outbursts against professional athletes protesting racial injustice and  the defiant response of n.f.l. teams on sunday  brought a renewed focus on political demonstrations during the national anthem at sports events.  such acts of protest, often by black athletes and  carried out recently by quarterback colin kaepernick  and others who have knelt for the anthem at n.f.l. games, have a long history in the united states and an equally lengthy tradition of angering mostly white fans, sports officials and politicians.  here’s a look at some of these controversies.            image     tommie smith, center, and john carlos, right, during the playing of “the star-spangled banner” at the mexico city games in 1968.   credit  associated press         1968: tommie smith and john carlos make their olympic salute  during a medal ceremony at the 1968 summer olympics in mexico city, two african-american track athletes made what would become one of the most famous political protests in the history of sports.        the athletes, tommie smith and john carlos, stood on the podium for the national anthem after winning gold and bronze medals and raised their black-gloved fists to the sky in what was widely viewed as a black power salute. under pressure from the international olympic committee, the united states olympic committee suspended them and sent them home.  on the times’s front page on oct. 19, 1968, the news was announced: “ 2 black power advocates ousted from olympics .” some members of the american delegation “hailed it as a gesture of independence and a move in support of a worthy cause,” the article said. “many others said they were offended and embarrassed. a few were vehemently indignant.”  the  swift punishment by olympic officials  served as a warning to others, the article said.   the action obviously tempered the behavior of negro american athletes who were involved in victory ceremonies today. in accepting their medals for their one, two, three sweep of the 400-meter run, lee evans, larry james and ron freeman wore black berets, but in no way conducted themselves in a manner to incur official wrath.             image        wayne collett, left, and vince matthews at the 1972 olympics in munich.   credit  associated press         1972: vince matthews and wayne collett are barred from the olympics  four years after the 1968 controversy, a new one arose. the track athletes vince matthews and wayne collett, who were also both black, took the podium in munich, at a time when officials feared a repeat of the mexico city gesture.  the times’s  2010 obituary  for mr. collett said that as the anthem was played, the pair “did not face the flag.”        “they stood casually, hands on hips, their jackets unzipped,” the times reported. “they chatted and fidgeted.”  the obituary added: “when the anthem ended and they climbed off the stand, the crowd booed. matthews twirled his medal and collett gave a black power salute.”  the two men were barred from olympic competition by the international olympic committee, an action that  the times described in an editorial  as an “authoritarian decree.”  the editorial continued, “unquestionably, the slouching, defiant posture of the two black athletes did no credit to either, but the persistence they had shown in training up to perfection pitch demonstrated that they had no lack of the olympic ‘ethic.’”  1973: fans on long island boo college athletes  fans at a college track meet at nassau coliseum on long island  went from agitated to furious in january 1973  when at least one athlete lay on the ground during the national anthem.  as the music played, at least one runner from eastern michigan university continued to warm up on the floor, the times reported. another athlete, “wearing an adelphi uniform, was also observed reclining on the ground.”  several fans began shouting, the article said, and after the anthem, “most of the 8,551 spectators joined in the booing.”        the article continued: “some chanted ‘throw them out!’ others shouted racial epithets at the athletes, who were black.”            image              later, the eastern michigan runner would say: “i was just stretching out, preparing for my race. i didn’t mean any protest, and i’m sorry i caused such a commotion.”  but the booing continued, and some officials threatened to walk off the floor if eastern michigan was allowed to compete. the team was disqualified.  the times quoted bob parks, the eastern michigan coach, “who is white and wears his hair very closely cropped,” as saying: “i’m as conservative as anyone around. i stand and sing for the anthem. i think the kids should stand, too, and i’m going to give them hell. but why disqualify the whole team?”  mr. parks said he was surprised by the reaction of the crowd. “at our place, when they play ‘the star-spangled banner’ at basketball games, a lot of the black students don’t stand,” he said. “i guess things are different here.”        1973: madison square garden drops the anthem, then reverses its decision  “amid growing controversy over whether it should be played at sports events,”  a front-page article in the times on jan. 16, 1973 , reported, “the national anthem has been dropped from the olympic invitational track and field meet at madison square garden.”  the times quoted the meet’s director as saying that playing the anthem was not obligatory because “its purpose and relevance to sports events has never been established.”  a day later, the front page told a different story: “ garden to hear anthem at track meet, after all .”  the reversal came after the united states olympic committee was deluged with “irate calls from all over the country,” the times reported.            image        mahmoud abdul-rauf, center, of the denver nuggets praying before an n.b.a. game in march 1996.   credit  m. spencer green/associated press         1996: the n.b.a. suspends mahmoud abdul-rauf  in march 1996, the national basketball association  suspended mahmoud abdul-rauf  of the denver nuggets for his refusal to stand during the national anthem.  mr. abdul-rauf, who converted to islam in 1991, said he did not believe in standing for any nationalistic ideology.        the real problem, according to  an editorial in the times , “was not the wisdom or accuracy of mr. abdul-rauf’s view that the flag is ‘a symbol of oppression,’ or that islamic teachings require that he not stand for the anthem.”  “it was the n.b.a.’s blindness to the fact that trying to force participation in a patriotic exercise undermines democratic values.”       ',\n",
       " 'gangneung, south korea — a couple dozen south korean reporters bumped and jostled one another while trying to keep up with ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik, the olympic figure skating pair from north korea, as they racewalked toward the exits after a practice at the gangneung ice arena on saturday afternoon.  questions were shouted by the scrum.  “how was the practice?”  “how are you feeling?”  there were no answers.  “do you want to stop and talk?” james cowley, an olympics official wrangling the news media at the arena, asked kim in english. it was unclear whether kim heard or understood the question, but he kept walking, a big smile on his face.  for the past three days, after the north korean athletes arrived with the heavy expectations that their participation here in these winter games would tone down tension on the korean peninsula, this cat-and-mouse game has played out. south korean journalists have trailed them everywhere.        it has injected a dose of commotion to a normally quiet period before the start of competition.  south korean journalists have trained high-powered lenses on the north korean delegation. local reporters have shuttled from one training session to another, clamoring for sound bites that never materialize. and the mixed zone — the area inside competition venues where journalists can interview athletes — has become a theater of the absurd, one that reporters, competitors and organizers are still trying to figure out.  early on saturday, the north koreans’ silence in the mixed zone was broken, finally, when kim hyon-son, the skaters’ coach, called out, “i’m happy we have been welcomed this way!”  and then she and her skaters were gone. the entire interaction lasted less than a minute. the reporters dispersed, shaking their heads.  over 40 members of the news media — as well as a couple dozen local volunteers — had shown up to watch kim and ryom practice on saturday morning, and a similar number showed up for the pair’s second practice six hours later.  things could change over the coming days as athletes and journalists from other countries arrive, but for now the north koreans have dominated the early olympic news cycle.        some in south korea have been less than pleased. last month, hong joon-pyo, the leader of the conservative opposition liberty korea party, warned that the pyeongchang olympics were becoming the pyongyang olympics, a cheeky play on the similar sounding name of the north korean capital, which has already caused confusion.  north korea canceled a cultural event it had planned in south korea a few days before the opening ceremony on friday, blaming what it called “insulting” news media coverage in south korea.  but the fascination has hardly ebbed.  the joint korean women’s hockey team, which features 12 north korean women joining the south korean team, has become a compelling story line of the games. there are also three cross-country skiers, three alpine skiers and two short-track speedskaters from north korea set to compete.  the appearance of north korean flags at the athletes’ village on thursday and friday — a rare sight in south korea, where such displays would normally be illegal — created a couple of days of news. and then there were the reports on saturday that more than 150,000 people had entered a lottery for tickets to a pair of performances next week by a 140-member north korean art troupe.  the zeal with which the local press has pursued the north korean visitors could be seen late friday at the skating rink, where the short-track speedskaters choe un-song and jong kwang-bom were working out alongside skaters from france, italy and latvia.  when the north korean skaters and their coach huddled along the railing to talk, a dozen reporters crept as close as possible to observe the interactions and snap pictures. minutes later, when the north koreans regrouped farther down the rink, the pack sidled that way, too. on they went this way, like moths to a flame.  things became hectic midway through the session after choe lost his footing around a turn and crashed into the perimeter padding with a thud.        as soon as it became clear that choe was not getting up, the journalists swarmed to get as close to him as possible and jostled for position. choe was carried away on a stretcher, and the reporters dashed to the mixed zone.  as one could have expected, though, jong and yun chol, the pair’s coach, walked through without saying a word or acknowledging the horde of reporters skipping along beside them.  afterward, an olympic staff member could be overheard explaining to her colleagues that she had needed to cajole the north koreans to walk through the mixed zone, which all athletes are required to do at the olympics. she said she had reminded them that they did not need to say anything, tracing her thumb and index fingers along her lips, pretending to zip them up.  on saturday night, another chaotic, moving mass formed after ryom and kim, the figure skaters, finished their evening workout. more benign questions, more awkward silences. kim marched through, sweat glistening on his face, and did not utter a word.  but the reporters kept at it, and their persistence was rewarded, albeit in a small way, when ryom responded to a question about how she felt. “good,” she said,

       " 'russia is nominally barred from the coming winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, because of its state-backed doping program and an elaborate cheating scheme carried out at the last winter games. but russia announced on thursday it would send a robust team of 169 athletes to the games, where they will compete as individual “olympic athletes from russia.”  that number is not far off the size of the russian teams at past winter olympics. russia had 232 athletes at the sochi games in 2014, where it dominated the medal standings, and 177 in vancouver in 2010.  the international olympic committee  announced in december  that russian government officials would be forbidden to attend the 2018 games, the nation’s flag would not be displayed and its anthem would not be played.  but olympic officials also said that athletes from russia could receive special dispensation to compete if they satisfied the scrutiny of an antidoping review panel.        the work of that review panel, conducted over the last month, was opaque, even as antidoping regulators requested that the criteria used to evaluate each russian athlete be made public. leading up to the 2016 summer olympics in rio, the i.o.c. had reversed the presumption of innocence, considering all russian athletes tainted by their nation’s system of cheating unless they could prove a history of rigorous drug testing.  last friday, global olympic officials announced they had  cleared 389 russian athletes  to potentially compete in pyeongchang, a generous pool that some criticized as neutering the sting of the i.o.c.’s punishment on a major sports power that had brazenly breached drug-testing controls.  “to protect the rights of clean athletes,” antidoping officials from 20 nations  said  in a statement last week, “it is necessary for the bar to be higher for oar to compete in the upcoming olympic winter games,” they said, using the acronym for olympic athletes from russia.  on thursday, the i.o.c. named 17 factors it had taken into account in weighing eligibility for the potential russian olympians. among the issues considered, the organization said, was each athlete’s possible implication in a  sprawling investigation  that raised questions about more than 1,000 athletes across 30 sports.  officials also took into account a giant database regulators obtained from whistle-blowers last fall, reflecting incriminating drug tests from russia’s national drug-testing lab in moscow. the i.o.c. did not specify, however, how those criteria were applied, or if an athlete’s implication had necessarily constituted an automatic disqualification.        a spokesman for the i.o.c. said thursday he had not seen the russian olympic committee’s list. “the official list of invited russian athletes will not be released before the delegate registration meeting on saturday,” he said.  thomas bach, the top global olympic official, has defended his choice to allow a “new generation” of russian athletes to compete. last week the i.o.c. barred 111 others from taking part in the games ever again, and more than 50 doctors and coaches were denied invitations.  forty-two russian olympians have been banned for life as a result of the doping scandal, a punishment that the majority of those athletes have been litigating before the top international sports court this week, hoping to be exonerated before the games open on feb. 9.  russia’s full delegation, the russian news agency  tass reported,  will be 340 people. many of the athletes are expected to be first-time olympians, the i.o.c. said. still, some may occupy competition spots earned by their banned compatriots, who have been competing across numerous winter sports this season and qualifying for the games in spite of their inability to attend.  a number of gold medal contenders are on russia’s list, including the figure skating star evgenia medvedeva. last month, medvedeva traveled with top russian sports officials to lausanne, switzerland, where the i.o.c.’s headquarters are, to lobby olympic executives hours before they announced russia’s punishment.  international paralympic officials barred all russian athletes from the 2016 games in rio, in contrast to their olympic counterparts, who ultimately  cleared  roughly 270. the paralympic committee is expected to announce its decision about russia’s participation in the 2018 games on monday.

       " 'north korea has  agreed to send a team  to the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea next month.  while the decision may help defuse nuclear tension with the west, in terms of sports, it is unlikely to bring the emergence of a hidden-away north korea version of shaun white or  yuzuru hanyu .  it is not known how many north koreans will wind up participating. but the athletes who do are not likely to shake up the medal table.  so far, north korea has qualified only two athletes for the games,  t he  figure skating pair  of ryom tae-ok and kim ju-sik. they missed a deadline to apply for a spot, but that is expected to be overlooked. the international olympic committee has also indicated a willingness to grant some wild-card entries to other north korean athletes.  ryom and kim were 15th at the last world championships, and few expect them to improve much on that performance at the games.        beyond ryom and kim, the prospective crop of athletes are mostly unknown on the international scene. many recent world championships in winter sports, including the traditional korean strengths of short and long track speedskating, have had no north korean entrants at all.  although it is possible that north korea has a hidden gem — its 1964 speedskating silver medalist, han pil-hwa, came out of nowhere — it seems as if most of its athletes will be destined for also-ran finishes.  the biggest impact by the north korean delegation at pyeongchang might be by the cheerleading squad or performance art group it plans to send.  north korea has attended winter games sporadically, starting in 1964. it has won two medals, a silver in speedskating in 1964 and a bronze in short-track speedskating in 1992.  north korea failed to qualify any athletes four years ago. in 2010, its two athletes, a figure skater and a speedskater, did not finish better than ninth.        north korea has been much more successful in the summer games. it has competed in them since 1972, though it boycotted the 1984 games in los angeles and the 1988 games in seoul. it has won 54 medals, 16 of them gold, in events including weight lifting, wrestling, gymnastics and boxing.  it won two gold and seven total medals in 2016 in rio de janeiro. both of its winners, in gymnastics and weight lifting, were the favorites going in.  in november 1987, nearly a year before the summer games in seoul, a south korean airliner exploded, killing more than 100 people. western intelligence agencies say north korea was responsible and the united states considers it a terrorist attack. just last month, foreign policy magazine ran  a disquieting headline : “will north korea blow up the winter olympics?”  though we are unlikely to hear the north korean anthem next month, the attendance of its athletes surely comes as a relief to olympics organizers.

       " 'there was always another boy in the jacksonville, fla., neighborhood who thought he could outsprint chandra cheeseborough. so all the children would go watch them line up on an empty back street, and then cheeseborough would dust off this latest challenger as she had all the others.  “every weekend, someone new,” she said. “i kind of got the feeling after a while i was going to be good at this.”  it was just another fond memory for cheeseborough, 59, a two-time olympic gold medalist in 1984. she was at the new york athletic club this week, along with some of the greatest athletic stars in united states history, as part of the inaugural induction class for the national track and field high school hall of fame.  they were telling their origin stories, and something became obvious, very quickly: the older they get, the more fun they had when they were young. and, yes, the less money they made. it’s the same in every sport, really. why should track and field be any different?        their lives were lived back then in more than one lane. cheeseborough remembered playing several sports at jean ribault high school, while the world-record-setting hurdler renaldo nehemiah starred at quarterback and played varsity basketball for scotch plains-fanwood in new jersey — even while he was breaking the 13-second mark in the 120-yard hurdles in 1977.            image     renaldo nehemiah, a former world-record holder in the 110-meter hurdles, is now an agent for several track stars.   credit  dave sanders for the new york times         “the diversity kept you interested,” nehemiah said. “yes, we had more fun. of course, there was no financial component to it back then. now, there’s a strategy to it.”  you have to specialize early — as the more modern stars like allyson felix, who still competes at age 32, and alan webb, 35, testified at the induction. felix, a six-time olympic gold medalist, gave up basketball, her first love, by freshman year at los angeles baptist high school. webb dropped swimming to concentrate on middle-distance races, then posted a time of 3 minutes 53.43 seconds  in the mile in 2001  to shatter jim ryun’s prep mark from 1965. the swimming had taught him to push through pain, webb said, but there was just no time to juggle two sports.  the tales told by cheeseborough and nehemiah were more romantic, somehow. they competed when there was no great monetary reward awaiting at the tape, no nike endorsements; only the carrot of a college scholarship and a possible place on the united states olympic team.        nehemiah fell in love with hurdling while watching rod milburn win gold at the munich olympics in 1972. he, too, was the fastest kid on his block, and nehemiah would practice his new obsession by jumping over a split-rail fence, back and forth, honing his form.  “the balance, the power, it was such a graceful, pretty event,” nehemiah, 58, said. “i became one with the hurdle. i was a sponge, learning about the event reel-to-reel.”            image        nehemiah turned to football after college, as a wide receiver for the san francisco 49ers from 1982 to 1985.   credit  paul spinelli/associated press; bob martin/getty images         his mother died during his freshman year in high school, yet nehemiah pressed on through that difficult time and then through an injury that sidelined him for a full year. with a skinny 5-foot-10 frame, he decided to turn aside football scholarship offers and run track at maryland.  when modest trust funds became available to student-athletes in 1981, some of the financial pressure on him eased. the real money, though, could only be found elsewhere. he turned to football after college, as a wide receiver for the san francisco 49ers from 1982 to 1985. it wasn’t until nehemiah, nicknamed skeets, had collected some decent salaries in the n.f.l. that he came back to his first love, hurdling.  now, of course, everything is different for elite athletes. while track and field may struggle in america, the sport is popular in other countries. overseas, some track meets are hugely profitable. endorsements are available. usain bolt was estimated by forbes magazine to earn more than $23 million at the height of his career, in 2014. the global governing body for the sport, the i.a.a.f., awarded prize money totaling $3.2 million for its so-called diamond league events in 2017, and handed out $60,000 to first-place finishers at its world championships.  nehemiah fully understands these fresh dynamics because he is immersed in them. since 1998, he has been an agent for track stars like michael johnson, justin gatlin and felix, traveling 150,000 miles or so every year to keep up with events, and with his clients.        he has been on the management end for so long, this induction call came as a pleasant reminder of a past life.            image        cheeseborough at the 1984 united states olympic trials. she probably would have won more olympic medals, but the united states boycotted the 1980 moscow games.   credit  tony duffy/getty images         “i almost forgot i used to be someone in sports,” nehemiah said.  cheeseborough, back in high school, set records of 10.3 seconds at 100 yards and 23.3 seconds at 220 yards. she would probably own more olympic medals today, if not for the united states’ boycott of the moscow olympics in 1980. jimmy carter’s administration gave her, and others, a congressional gold medal in place of the real thing.  four years later, she took silver at 400 meters in the 1984 los angeles games, then captured two gold medals within an hour in the 4-by-100-meter and 4-by-400-meter relays. she was a memory to behold, flying down the track with that afro hairstyle, that lilting stride and name.  “i wasn’t tired at all,” she said about the tight olympic schedule. “if you lose, then you’re tired.”  many of the 26 hall of fame inductees planned to stick around for the national indoor championships at the armory in washington heights, held over the weekend. there were potential hall of famers to scout, and to recruit, like the sprinters tyrese cooper of miami and tamari davis of gainesville, fla.; and the two-miler katelyn tuohy of north rockland high school in thiells, n.y.  cheeseborough, as director of men’s and women’s track and field at tennessee state, knows about this new breed of athlete. she has learned to go with the flow.  “they all want to specialize now,” she said. “don’t want to do anything else.”  one-track minds, in a sport that now rewards narrower ambitions.

       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — they sprang up like mushrooms atop almost every table, countertop and reasonably flat surface at the olympic venues on thursday afternoon: freshly unpacked bottles of hand sanitizer.  lots of them.  by thursday night, 42 more cases of norovirus were confirmed around the sites of the 2018 winter olympics, bringing the official tally of cases this week to 128. a mere 24 hours before the opening ceremony of the games, the outbreak has threatened to undermine an otherwise watertight start to the global sports event.  determined not to let the quadrennial games spiral into a widespread gastrointestinal nightmare, the organizers on thursday seemed intent on carrying out a scorched-earth assault on every last germ in a 40-mile radius.  a troupe of young volunteers wound through the news media center in the afternoon, going from office to office to distribute hundreds of bottles of 62-percent ethanol hand sanitizer.        anyone entering the cafeteria in the athletes’ village was stopped and required to take a dollop of the stuff there, too, before going anywhere near the buffet.  competitors, olympic staff members and journalists claimed not to be panicking, but the quietly growing sense of wariness here was palpable. sneezes provoked sideways looks. fist bumps replaced handshakes. people washed their hands over and over and over again.  “we’ve got every-germ killing thing that you can have, just in case, and we’ve got masks if it gets bad enough,” said mitchell whitmore, an american speed skater at his third olympics.  along with the newly omnipresent bottles of hand sanitizer, organizers have engaged in an informational campaign, with multilingual posters popping up all around the olympic grounds.  at the media accommodations in gangneung, the city hosting the indoor ice events, a new flier appeared bearing the heading “cough etiquette &amp; proper hand washing,” with a cartoon drawing of soohorang, the smiley anthropomorphic white tiger mascot of the games, in pain, covering his mouth with his striped left paw.        at a news conference on wednesday night, dr. park kisoo, a spokesman for the korea centers for disease control and prevention, tried to temper the growing sense of worry here.  “you don’t need to go running out of the room if somebody sneezes,” park said.  park preached the importance of proactive personal hygiene. so along with wool caps and long underwear, bottles of hand sanitizer in varying shapes and sizes have become this year’s hottest olympic accessory.  never mind the studies showing they are largely ineffective in battling norovirus.  “the u.s.o.c. physician said that the antibacterial spray does not kill the norovirus,” said matt hamilton, an american curler competing in the men’s and mixed-doubles events, using the acronym for the united states olympic committee. “but what does do a good job is the ivory soap. so he’s just like, ‘soap up.’ ”  the buses that constitute the olympics’ internal transportation network have been running smoothly on schedule. the facilities, and the hospitality of those staffing them, have won early raves.  but the pesky virus has threatened to derail some of the early good vibes.  more than a thousand people have been quarantined as organizers have rushed to halt the spread of the virus, which can cause bouts of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. the military was called in to provide additional support to the decimated staff.  so far 97 of the cases have been at horeb youth centre, a dormitory that housed many local security staff members; 11 were in pyeongchang; 20 were in gangneung.  kimani griffin, an american speed skater and first-time olympian, said these sorts of outbreaks were always a possibility at major international sporting events, where visitors from around the globe are gathered into tight quarters, day after day.        “dining halls are usually a disaster; everyone’s touching everything,” griffin said. “we’ve definitely gone through every precaution we can take while traveling: wiping things down with clorox wipes, hand sanitizing, face masks, gloves, whatever we can do prevent ourselves from coming into contact with it.”  whitmore, griffin’s teammate, joked that the threat of illness would not throw him off his game.  “if michael jordan can play through the flu, i can race with the virus,” said whitmore, an american speed skater. “if i break my leg, i’m still racing.”       ',\n",
       " 'among those transfixed by the sentencing of dr. lawrence g. nassar, the sports doctor accused of molesting more than 160 girls and young women, were children throughout the country. their parents were faced with a uniquely vexing question: how — or whether — to discuss such an abhorrent sex crime.  over two weeks, dr. nassar’s very public sentencing hearing ripped through the gymnastics world. young gymnasts watched their heroes recount experiences of molestation or read comments on social media, leaving parents struggling with how to broach the subject with their daughters.  any major news event can present difficult parenting decisions. but the nassar case was particularly fraught because it involved young girls and appalling violations of their bodies.  “it’s a tricky situation,” adelia matson, whose daughter macy is a level 8 gymnast, said in a phone interview from her home in san luis obispo, calif. “i have definitely talked to her about abuse, but she’s as innocent as they come as far as a 12-year-old. it’s a bit of a balancing act of how to talk to them without revealing too much that they don’t need to know yet, but that they know how to protect themselves.”        on wednesday, hours after a judge gave dr. nassar a sentence of 40 to 175 years in prison, girls in sparkly leotards swung from uneven bars, while others tumbled on the blue gymnasium mats at chelsea piers in manhattan. from an elevated seating area, two dozen parents watched their children practice.  between gasping at falls and shouting encouragement, many parents were asking a variation of the same question: had everyone seen the latest testimony in the sentencing hearing?  ms. matson and her husband discussed how they should talk about sexual assault with macy after dr. nassar pleaded guilty last year. another mother said she participated in the women’s march with her daughter, but wondered if disclosing the details of the nassar case would cause her daughter to fear men.  on top of that, parents of older teenagers wondered what their children may have seen on social media that they were not aware of.  “the olympic team and the elite girls — they follow them on instagram; these are their role models and their heroes,” kelly craig said of her 12- and 14-year-old daughters, who practice at chelsea piers. “my 14-year-old has read all the statements. when they closed the ranch, my daughter showed me — she knew before i did.”        dr. nassar was previously sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. during his sentencing hearing in lansing, mich., over the past two weeks, more than 150 women — including prominent olympians — spoke about the abuse they endured.  there is no one set of guidelines to teach parents how to talk to their children about sexual assault. laura palumbo, the director of communications at the national sexual violence resource center, said that there was appropriate information to give children about sexual violence at every stage of development.  “one of the biggest misconceptions is that these conversations are too advanced or harmful for children to hear about,” ms. palumbo said. “in reality, the more information that we can give children from an early age about understanding your bodies and your boundaries and what types of touch are appropriate — not only does it give your child that information, it also lets them know that these are safe topics to talk to you about.”  sienna livengood, 10, had no idea why her idols were in the national spotlight. she worships the olympic gymnasts so much that in her free time, she is creating a short film about the journey of the fierce five, as the 2012 united states gymnastics team was called, to the london olympics.  sienna’s mother, jen livengood, said she talked to her daughter about sexual violence in general terms, but had not let her watch or read about the trial. the two of them talk about self-worth and having the confidence to speak up if something isn’t right.  “every parent has to be open to conversation, and not just in sports — it’s at church and in school,” said brandy bauman, the owner of go for it usa gymnasium in las vegas and a mother of two. “it’s everywhere you are trusting someone else with your child. our sport is getting a wake-up call.”       ',\n",
       " 'indianapolis — the calls to high school sports officials from athletic directors and administrators began several years ago and have only become more frequent and difficult: how are you handling transgender students who want to play sports?  with widespread disagreement over where the line should be drawn between sexes for purposes of athletic competition, the question has challenged the people who set rules for olympics sports and those who govern college sports in the united states. at the high school level, the issue has been even more vexing.  “quite frankly, i don’t think anyone has it exactly right because if they did, everyone else would just do that,” said jamey harrison, deputy director of the governing body of high school sports in texas. “if you look at what the n.c.a.a. is doing and what the olympics committee is doing — and those are different because they’re largely dealing with adults, versus we are working with minors — it doesn’t seem like anybody has landed on something that is universally applicable.”  the issue has touched off debate among coaches, athletes, parents, doctors and medical ethicists. established guidelines at the youth level that address things like hormonal treatment and sex reassignment surgery are nonexistent.        harrison said the issue first emerged in texas in 2012, when the state governing body — the university interscholastic league — had rules that required female athletes to compete on girls’ teams and males on boys’ teams, but no rule that addressed how to decide someone’s sex.  transgender students — those who identify as a different gender than their biological sex — did not fit into an existing category.  “we had more and more schools who said, ‘we have a student who is transitioning or transitioned,’” harrison said in a phone interview. “i think without question, it has become much more of a common issue than it had previously been. there are strong feelings on all sides and people are very passionate about their stance. it has been a challenge.”  with no national governing body laying down rules, individual states have navigated the issue independently, weighing the shifting beliefs of schools, parents and athletes.  in texas, superintendents from member schools voted in a referendum that the governing body should use birth certificates to determine a student’s sex. indiana uses anatomical sex to determine what team a student can play on. other states, including california, have adopted rules that allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms and participate on the teams that align with the gender the person identifies as.        the issue is particularly nettlesome with individuals who have transitioned from male to female because of the belief that they might still have a physical advantage until their hormone therapy — which not every transgender person chooses to have — is complete.  “when you start talking about transgender athletes, a male-to-female individual, we want to ensure that that is truly a decision that is permanent,” said bobby cox, the commissioner of the indiana high school athletic association. “it is not a decision that, ‘i just decided today that i am going to be a girl and i am going to go play on a girls’ team’ and perhaps, disadvantage those kids that are on the team and imbalance the competition.  “and as we progress down this path,’’ he added, “and as we spend more time and energy with advocacy groups and medical professionals in this area, i think that there will be additional amendments to our policies.”  there is no reliable data on the number of transgender high school athletes. only about 0.6 percent of the adult population identifies as transgender,  according to federal data from 2016 . researchers from the williams institute, who conducted the study,  reported that 0.56 percent of adults in indiana reported identifying as transgender .  in texas, 0.66 percent of adults said they identify as transgender, the fifth-highest percentage in the country (behind hawaii, california, new mexico and georgia). still, transgender children are considered an at-risk minority outside of sports. according to the new england journal of medicine, the rate of suicide attempts among transgender people is 40 percent, compared to 4.6 percent among those who are not transgender.  relatively new policies are already being massaged and amended. in july, the indiana state association voted unanimously to adjust its surgery requirement. it now no longer requires transgender students who are transitioning from female to male to have sex reassignment surgery in order to compete in the gender with which they identify. but that stipulation is still in place for someone transitioning from male to female.  the group asserts it is acting in the name of fairness, but transgender rights activists accuse members of simply not wanting transgender people to participate, out of fear that those athletes will have an unfair advantage.        olivia, who asked to be identified by first name, is transgender — born with male sex organs but now identifying as female. a high school sophomore in indiana, she kept her gender a secret from her coaches while playing freshman tennis so that she could play on the girls’ team. a handful of her teammates know that she is transgender, but it had not come up as a problem. olivia’s mother, melissa, said that she did not think the tennis coach knew that she was not biologically female.  when the state sports association did not loosen its surgery requirement for male-to-female athletes, olivia and her family decided to fight the ruling.  “imagine you are practicing your favorite sport one day when somebody comes and tell you that you are not able to participate on the team,” olivia wrote in a letter to association’s committee members. “so many emotions are swirling through your head: confusion, anger, embarrassment. not only does this take away your right to play, but it takes away something that defines you.”  indiana is not the only state that uses biological sex to determine what team an athlete is eligible to play on. the nebraska school activities association assembles a gender identity eligibility committee composed of a physician, psychiatrist, a school administrator and an association staff member. one criterion the committee may consider when deciding whether the student’s transgender student application is approved is if the student has had surgery.  dr. dennis fortenberry, who facilitates a clinic for transgender youth at riley hospital in indianapolis, said that he is concerned that the indiana state association’s rule is “essentially a full prohibition” of transgender participation in high school sports.  “it’s a practical prohibition because the complete set of surgeries — there are multiple — and completing all of them while someone has high school eligibility left is practically impossible,” fortenberry said in a phone interview. “i’ve never seen anyone under the age of 18 have both top and bottom surgery. that doesn’t mean those individuals don’t exist, but i haven’t seen them.”  harrison said the texas association did not consult medical personnel when the birth certificate rule was initially implemented in august 2016. a medical advisory subcommittee that included texas children’s hospital endocrinologist david paul was formed when  senate bill 2095 was proposed in february . the bill would have allowed the state athletics association to disqualify athletes who are taking steroids, including testosterone, if it deemed a student was getting an unfair competitive advantage. the committee met once and dr. paul called in to the meeting.        dr. paul said that if fairness is the concern, schools should be looking at students’ testosterone levels. testosterone helps build muscle mass. before puberty, boys and girls have similarly low testosterone levels, causing them to have similar builds and physical capabilities. after puberty, a healthy adult male will have testosterone levels far above that of a healthy woman.  dr. paul said that if someone is taking enough testosterone to be within the post-puberty male range, even if he was born biologically female, he should be competing against males. and to have balanced competition, people who are transitioning from male to female should have to have their testosterone levels within female range in order to compete against women, he said.  “the problem is, what testosterone level confers an advantage?” dr. paul said. “testosterone has been scientifically proven to increase the athletic performance and that’s part of the reason adolescent boys have higher high jump records and faster 100 meter times than adolescent girls. if part of that is testosterone driven, then you can’t allow a male to compete against women. it wouldn’t be fair. if you are a transgender person — whether you are trans female or trans male — it really depends on how much testosterone you have.”  joanna harper, a medical physicist, conducted a study examining the race times of transgender athletes, trying to prove whether taking hormones had an effect on their performances. over a period of seven years, she collected transgender female runners’ race times. the study found that “collectively, the eight runners had much slower race times in the female gender than as males.” the study suggests that it is possible to achieve athletic fairness through hormone therapy.  some transgender activists argue that no one should be forced to alter their body with hormones or surgery. hormone therapy can be expensive and inconvenient.  despite complications with individual state policies, harrison and cox said they had reservations about having a national institution set rules for all high school sports.  “having a single gender policy for all state associations would be very difficult,” cox said. “i think it would be difficult because of what people believe in california is not necessarily what people believe in iowa. our country is diverse. state associations should make those decisions as opposed to a national body because they are more well versed in their individual state needs. that job is better left to state associations that are closer to the member school and have relationships

( a team video  shows the assistant coach jarron collins next to a picture of his twin brother, jason collins, who  in 2013  became one of the first openly gay athletes in a major american sports league.) and the cleveland cavaliers’ lebron james, along with his foundation and business partner, donated $2.5 million toward the ali exhibition.        “his support will help us to continue the story of muhammad ali and will encourage athletes to realize how important athletics is in terms of social justice,” the museum’s founding director, lonnie bunch,  told usa today  when the gift was announced.  the marriage of athletics and social justice, in fact, was a founding principle behind the permanent sports exhibition, according to that gallery’s curator, damion thomas. the choice is immediately apparent to visitors: the first thing one sees when approaching the permanent sports exhibition is a statue of the 200-meter medalists at the 1968 olympics in mexico city, where two of them, the americans tommie smith and john carlos, raised their gloved fists in the black power salute.  “i very rarely give a sports statistic during these tours,” thomas said as he walked through some upper-level rooms on a recent visit. instead, he said, the gallery “focuses on sports in the larger african-american struggle and fight for greater rights.”  given the way james and other n.b.a. players have embraced more activist, and more public, roles as spokesmen  on social issues  and as  advocates for black americans  in recent years, the synergy between the league and the museum seemed natural, said devin booker, who visited the museum with his team, the phoenix suns, in november.  “we’re realizing how much power we have, how people listened to us,” booker said, pointing as an example to a joint statement issued at the beginning of last year’s espy awards show by four n.b.a. stars, including james, about police violence.          “we’re realizing our voice matters,” booker added.  winslow concurred, saying: “deep down inside, nine out of 10 athletes are genuine at heart and want to give back. i think athletes are some of the best role models.”        harry edwards, the sociologist who has played a significant role in athlete activism over the past half-century — and who both consulted on the african-american history museum’s sports exhibition and is featured in it — said he had heard from numerous athletes about the impressions the museum had made on them.  “they are so moved by a lot of what they see,” edwards said, adding: “history is a very telescoped thing to them. so when they look back and can not only see the history of the past but put into context with developments today, they become very excited about learning more.”  team tours are frequently conducted via special arrangement when the museum is closed, given the attention the athletes themselves can draw. museum officials said the tours often begin with a talk about how the athletes can help in the future, including through financial donations but also through the donations of artifacts or items that might offer a more personal connection to the museum’s mission.            image        courtney lee, left, and joakim noah during the knicks’ tour of the museum. nearly half of the n.b.a.’s 30 teams have had members visit, museum officials said.   credit  tom zweibel/knicks.com         the appeal itself is an acknowledgment of a new reality: a growing number of talented black athletes, endowed with both fortunes and platforms that were largely unavailable to their counterparts in past eras, increasingly see themselves not only as role models, but also as businessmen and philanthropists.  winslow recalled that the museum’s pitch was brief and friendly, along the lines of: “we would love a donation.”        “they did ask me for something — a guy thought i played in the r.b.i. program,” said sabathia, referring to the reviving baseball in inner cities program. the official was mistaken — sabathia never played in the program — but, sabathia said: “i got excited for a second when he wanted some of my stuff. it would be cool to be a part of it in any way.”  among the most memorable exhibits for sabathia were those detailing the plight of black jockeys, who dominated the kentucky derby in its early years before they were slowly phased out of competition about a century ago, and the ones that detailed black activism during the civil rights movement, including carlos and smith’s medal-stand protest in 1968.  “you think about the responsibilities of the black athlete in the ’50s and ’60s, it was actually protesting, not going to the olympics,” said sabathia, who recently spoke out about racism he has experienced while playing at fenway park in boston.  “for whatever i need to do to do my part, i’ll do that,” he added. “i think we have it light compared to what some of those guys went through.”       ',\n",
       " 'with top olympics officials expected imminently to announce a punishment for russia over its elaborate sports doping scheme, the whistle-blower who played a central role in the illicit program said he was in favor of allowing russian athletes who can establish their innocence to compete under a neutral flag at the coming winter games in pyeongchang, south korea.  “innocent athletes should not be prevented from participating,” dr. grigory rodchenkov, russia’s former longtime antidoping laboratory chief, said in an email exchange on friday and saturday with the new york times through his lawyer — his first interview since being put under protection of united states authorities.  international olympic committee officials will announce tuesday how they will handle the matter of russia’s eligibility at the winter games in february. an extreme option would be barring every member of the russian delegation from participating, regardless of whether they are linked to doping. dr. rodchenkov said he supported one of the options that the officials are considering: allowing clean russian athletes to compete but keeping all russian emblems out of the games.  in recent weeks, dr. rodchenkov’s detailed account about widespread breaches of drug-testing controls at the 2014 olympics in sochi, russia — as well as his  contemporaneous notes  from that time and digital evidence related to his lab work — have been shared with olympic officials.        at issue is the extent to which those global officials determine that russian government and olympic officials were complicit in the cheating plots, which have so far resulted in 25 russian olympians having been disqualified from sochi. russian officials have forcefully disputed state involvement, accusing dr. rodchenkov of acting alone and criminally charging him with abuse of authority.  dr. rodchenkov has linked russia’s former sports minister, vitaly mutko, and mr. mutko’s deputy sports minister, yuri nagornykh, to the cheating schemes, asserting they ordered him and others to tamper with more than 100 steroid-laced urine samples in sochi, and to conceal similar cheating in the years before and after the 2014 games.  in the interview with the times, he named a new figure as having been actively involved in what he called “the sochi plan”: alexander kravtsov, the current president of russia’s biathlon union. mr. kravtsov served as the diplomatic head of the russian national team at the sochi games on behalf of the russian olympic committee.  “at various times, i spoke to alexander kravtsov about the use of performance-enhancing drugs generally, and about the sochi plan in particular,” dr. rodchenkov said, adding that mr. kravtsov’s personal driver had at times transported agents of the federal security service to russia’s national antidoping laboratory ahead of the games, to help study and surreptitiously break into the supposedly  tamper-proof glass bottles  used to collect urine at international sports events.  emphasizing how central the sport of biathlon was in the nation’s cheating, dr. rodchenkov said that mr. nagornykh had asked him to incriminate a ukrainian athlete, vita semerenko, during a competition in moscow leading up to the olympics.        “he was particularly concerned with ukrainian female biathletes, who posed the most serious challenge to russia’s relay team during the sochi games,” dr. rodchenkov said, going on to add that the deputy minister had asked him to “make the sample dirty” to disqualify ms. semerenko. dr. rodchenkov did not comply, he said, convincing the minister that a retest of the drug sample would show the drugs had been spiked into the sample rather than passed through a human body.  “i could not have done this to an innocent athlete,” he said. “during my career, i reported many dirty samples as clean, but never the other way around.”  mr. nagornykh, who was also a member of the russian olympic committee, was dismissed by the russian sports ministry after an investigation commissioned by the global regulator of drugs in sports confirmed dr. rodchenkov’s story last year.  attempts to reach mr. kravtsov and mr. nagornykh on saturday through the biathlon union and the sports ministry were not immediately successful.  dr. rodchenkov’s lawyer declined to let him respond to some questions based on pending investigations. since last year, dr. rodchenkov has been living in the united states under the protection of american authorities. his information on systematic russian doping is believed to be relevant to continuing  investigations  in the united states and abroad.  in august, “icarus,” a film detailing dr. rodchenkov’s move to the united states and tell-all account, was released. it includes a scene in which dr. rodchenkov was fingerprinted before being taken into hiding.

       " 'munich — the gray space is carved directly into a grassy hillside, evoking an open wound.  in this way, the munich 1972 massacre memorial, set to open on sept. 6, is emblematic of the pain that has endured for many since that year’s olympic games, when 11 members of the israeli team and one german police officer  were killed  by members of the palestinian group black september.  the memorial, family members of the victims said, will bring them yet another step closer to peace.  “there are no happier people, no more satisfied people, than us,” said ankie spitzer, whose husband, andre, a fencing coach, was among those killed at the munich games. “it took 45 years, but like i tell my kids, if you have a dream, pursue it, if you feel that it is just.”  satisfaction has been a long time coming. the healing process? that still feels incomplete.  family members of the victims — organized by spitzer and ilana romano, the widow of the weight lifter yossef romano —  spent decades  asking the international olympic committee for a formal acknowledgment of the massacre at the games. last year, at the summer olympics in rio de janeiro, one finally took place, with  a ceremony and the installation of a monument  in the rio olympic village.        but spitzer and the other families had also urged the bavarian government for years to erect a comprehensive memorial and museum at the olympic park, where the israeli team members were initially taken hostage. two team members were killed there, and the rest, as well as the german policeman, died during a chaotic rescue attempt at a nearby air base.            image     the israeli delegation at the opening ceremony in munich.   credit  agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         until now, a sculpture and plaque have been the two primary memorials in the olympic park. but for decades the memorial request was largely ignored, until  more-sympathetic ears  arrived in the leadership of the olympic committee and the local government in recent years.  “it is late,” said ludwig spaenle, the bavarian minister of culture, whose office led the project. “but it is not too late.”  the new memorial rests unassumingly along a quiet walking path in munich’s  olympic park . visitors to the site descend a short set of steps to enter the main space, which has the effect of stepping into a sanctuary. the exhibition area, which measures about 1,700 square feet, seems almost like a cave, resting under a thick mound of grass and blending into a backdrop of linden trees.  along the back wall, a large led screen, about 36 feet long, will play a 27-minute loop of news footage broadcast during the crisis. in the center of the memorial, a triangular column will display biographical profiles of each victim in german and english, with photographs.        “our design idea was to cut into the hill, to take something away from the landscape,” said stephan graebner, an architect at brückner &amp; brückner, the german firm selected in 2014 to design the memorial. “when you think about the massacre, it took something away, cutting into the lives of the victims, the families, the olympic games. we wanted to fill this void with memory.”            image        ilano romano, left, and ankie spitzer, who both lost their husbands in the 1972 attack, in london in 2012. romano, spitzer and other victims&rsquo; families led a 45-year campaign for a comprehensive memorial to their loved ones in munich.   credit  lefteris pitarakis/associated press         among the most poignant elements of the exhibition are the personal effects, one for each victim, that were photographed for the memorial.  there is, for example, a postcard that the athlete ze’ev friedman sent to his parents from munich before the attack. it arrived in their mailbox days after his death. there is a copy of a telegram that golda meir, the former israeli prime minister, sent to the united states to the parents of david berger, an israeli weight lifter who grew up in shaker heights, ohio. “i know that no mortal word can assuage your grief,” meir wrote to the bergers, adding that “the pain is not only yours but that of a whole nation.”  werner karg, an official in the bavarian ministry of culture, said it was unfortunate that haunting images of masked terrorists were more prominent in the public consciousness today than the memories, and the faces, of the victims. the memorial, he said, could help change that.  “we can show that these were individuals, ordinary people, not just names,” karg said.  spitzer has attended every olympics since the munich games to press for a more concrete remembrance of the massacre. she was rebuffed for decades, she said, often being told that politics do not belong at the olympics. that stance, the families knew, was always a convenient way to avoid the issue.  “we always said that if it had been the american dream team, we don’t think they would have to fight for such a long time and beg and ask,” spitzer said.            image        ankie spitzer spoke on the 40th anniversary of the munich olympics massacre in 2012 in germany. her husband, andre, a fencing coach, was killed during a failed rescue attempt.      credit  guenter schiffmann/agence france-presse — getty images         at the 2012 olympics in london, the international olympic committee shut down widespread calls for a televised moment of silence during the opening ceremony to mark the 40th anniversary of the massacre, a decision that drew criticism from many quarters and improvised moments from others. on nbc’s broadcast of that ceremony, for instance, the announcer bob costas  paused his commentary for 12 seconds  when the delegation from israel entered the stadium, effectively creating his own moment of silence.  “terrorist attacks and other outrages happen, sadly, on a constant basis,” costas said in an interview. “but this one struck the olympics itself. that’s what separated it: not that it was more tragic or more significant than others, but that it was directly tied to the olympics.”  progress started to come shortly thereafter. spaenle, the bavarian culture minister, met spitzer and other victims’ families in 2012, months after the london games, at a ceremony at fürstenfeldbruck air base, where the hostage situation came to its tragic end. at that meeting, he pledged to work on the memorial project, and he met again with spitzer and romano several times in germany and israel.  thomas bach, who was elected president of the olympic committee in 2013, proved more supportive of the families’ cause than his predecessors, and quickly backed the project, too. bach, who won a gold medal in fencing for west germany at the 1976 games, also greenlighted the ceremony in the olympic village in rio, where he read the names of the munich victims.  “the murdered israeli olympians were victims of an attack at the heart of the olympic games and against all the olympic values,” bach said. “it is therefore fitting that these innocent victims should be remembered forever with a dignified memorial at a place close to the olympic village. it will be a symbol of remembrance and our shared grief.”            image        the israeli weight lifter yosef romano in 1972. a memorial in munich will contain personal mementos of each person killed in that summer’s olympic massacre, an effort by designers to memorialize the dead as individuals, not only as victims.   credit  courtesy of ilana romano, via getty images         the memorial and exhibition cost about 2.4 million euros (more than $2.8 million), according to karg, with contributions from the bavarian government, the german federal government, the olympic committee and  the foundation for global sports development , an american organization focused on promoting sportsmanship.  the project will finish a year behind schedule. pushback from local residents twice forced organizers to move the project site, making the architects redesign the memorial each time. the site will be open to the public after a closed ceremony on sept. 6 attended by members of the german and israeli governments, the olympic committee and the victims’ families.  barbara holzer, an architect from zurich who served on the jury to select the project proposal, said any memorial had to be “a site that gives room to societal and individual reflection.” that process, for many, will begin anew here.  spaenle was an 11-year-old living near the olympic park when the massacre took place 45 years ago. he still remembers hearing the helicopters flying overhead when the terrorists were transferring the hostages to fürstenfeldbruck, and he was inside the olympic stadium when avery brundage, the olympic committee president at the time, controversially declared after their deaths that “the games must go on.”  spaenle has long been familiar with  the two more-modest memorials  at two other sites in the olympic park — a sculpture by the german artist fritz koenig and a plaque outside the apartment where the hostages were held — “but all the time, i felt like something was missing,” spaenle said.  “this,” he said, “is the missing link.”       ',\n",
       " 'lansing, mich. — armed with pieces of paper etched with their memories of sexual abuse, they stepped forward, one by one — nearly 100 of them, with more to come.  for four full days this week, in a fluorescent-lighted courtroom here, women and girls — some of them the best gymnasts in the country, others with dreams prematurely crushed, they said, by a man who now sat in handcuffs 10 feet away — leaned into a microphone to address him, sometimes through sobs, sometimes with screams, but always with determination.  aly raisman, 23, who won gold medals at the past two summer olympics, told of late-night knocks on her hotel door while she was competing overseas, as the man, dr.  lawrence g. nassar , then the team doctor, arrived to abuse her.  a teammate at the 2012 london games, jordyn wieber, who until friday had not identified herself as a victim of dr. nassar’s, recalled the torment of the games, where she was a part of the american team that won a gold medal but, she said, had to submit to his care under the auspices of the sport’s governing body, u.s.a. gymnastics.        “our bodies were all hanging by a thread in london,” she said. “who was the doctor that u.s.a.g. sent? the doctor who was our abuser.”  for other young athletes just striking out, there seemed little they could do but give in, buckling under the pressure of knowing so many stars had seemingly benefited from him. and so a young gymnast named chelsea zerfas, now 15, spoke of anguished probing, under the guise of treatment, face down on an exam room table when she was 13, feeling helpless to challenge a doctor at that age.  the occasion of the hearing, to help a judge decide dr. nassar’s prospective sentence on state charges of nearly a dozen sexual assaults, appeared almost beside the point. he had been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on a child pornography conviction, and the judge in this state court hearing has said that dr. nassar, 54, who has pleaded guilty to several sexual-assault charges, can expect to spend the rest of his life in prison.  but before then, she allowed so-called victim impact statements from the 140 girls and women whom prosecutors accuse dr. nassar of abusing, leading to days of wrenching testimony here that has evolved into not only a nationally televised reckoning of his crimes but an indictment of a sport that his victims say did little to protect them.  at the same time, the hearing has dovetailed with the continued expansion of the #metoo movement that seeks to hold predatory men to account — in this case, in excruciating detail.        “come hell or high water, we will find a way to take every last one of you down that could have stopped this monster,” said amy labadie, a former gymnast who testified friday morning. she added, “it’s hard to see into the future and not think this will affect me forever.”            more than 160 women say larry nassar sexually abused them. here are his accusers in their own words.  he was lauded as the must-see doctor who worked with america’s best gymnasts. now lawrence g. nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison. over seven days, women recounted his sexual abuse at a marathon sentencing hearing in michigan.       some of the victims described how the team doctor’s actions spawned suicidal thoughts and ruptured their families, how they hoped he would rot in prison, and how they desperately wanted the blame and repercussions to extend far beyond him — to the people and the organizations that turned a blind eye.  “imagine feeling like you have no power and no voice,” ms. raisman said friday. “well, you know what, larry? i have both power and voice, and i am only just beginning to use them. all these brave women have power, and we will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: a life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.”  dr. nassar pleaded guilty in november to seven counts of sexual assault, and his sentencing hearing, which began tuesday, is now expected to continue next week, as the number of women who have wanted to speak in court has grown, from 88 to 105 to 120, at last count — emboldened by what has happened here this week. judge rosemarie aquilina said she had cleared her docket.  “you are all superheroes,” the judge said friday morning after one of the victims, choking back tears, read her statement.  dr. nassar entered the courtroom at 9:04 a.m. he wore a dark blue prison uniform. after he reached the witness box, where he has sat with a hangdog expression since the hearing began, he appeared to recognize that ms. raisman and ms. wieber were seated together in the front row. dr. nassar looked down and slowly shook his head.        ms. wieber, 22, was the first person to testify on friday — but the 69th to have her statement heard since the proceedings began. ms. wieber said dr. nassar began treating her when she was 8. like many of those who came before her, ms. wieber said that dr. nassar had manipulated her by bringing her food and coffee at pressure-cooker training camps where such luxuries were prohibited.  “nobody was protecting us from being taken advantage of,” ms. wieber said. “nobody was ever concerned whether or not we were being sexually abused.”  ms. raisman took clear aim at both u.s.a. gymnastics and the united states olympic committee when she appeared in court on friday.  “neither u.s.a. gymnastics nor the u.s.o.c. have reached out to express sympathy or even offer support,” she said. “not even to ask: ‘how did this happen? what do you think we can do to help?’ why have i and others here, probably, not heard anything from the leadership at the u.s.o.c.? why has the united states olympic committee been silent? why isn’t the u.s.o.c. here right now?”  mark jones, a spokesman for the olympic committee, said in a statement that it first became aware of the possibility that a physician with the gymnastics federation had been abusing athletes in 2015.  “at that time, u.s.a. gymnastics indicated that they were in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement agencies,” mr. jones said. “we are heartbroken that this abuse occurred, proud of the brave victims that have come forward and grateful that our criminal justice system has ensured that nassar will never be able to harm another young woman.”            image     dr. nassar, the former doctor for the united states national women’s gymnastics team, pleaded guilty to molestation charges in november.   credit  brendan mcdermid/reuters         at the same time, mr. jones said, the olympic committee will continue to press for “meaningful change” in the gymnastics federation.        the federation announced on thursday that it would  cut ties with karolyi ranch , a renowned training facility that was one of the places where dr. nassar molested the gymnasts.  “the development camp taking place through sunday is the last u.s.a. gymnastics activity at the ranch,” the federation said in a statement on friday. “next week’s training camp for the u.s. women’s national team is canceled and the acro world team trials scheduled for the first week in february has been relocated.”  kara johnson, now a high school student, spoke about how she was taken to dr. nassar for back and hip treatment when she was a 13-year-old runner. dr. nassar, she said, placed her on a table on her stomach and then molested her. she described how he left the room, returned with a lubricant and repeated the abuse. he then smacked her on her “bare butt,” called her “sweetie” and told her that if she ever had her period when she came to see him, to be sure to let him know, she said.  “how was i supposed to know at the age of 13 what was medically acceptable and what the boundaries were?” she said.  her sister madeline was also abused. now 15, she told the court that as a 12-year-old gymnast, she was sent to dr. nassar for back treatment and underwent the same abuse. “at only 12 years old, i had no idea that it was inappropriate, illegal and wrong,” she said.   on thursday , mckayla maroney, 22, another olympic gymnast, said she had “scars” that might never heal after being abused by dr. nassar, starting when she was 13 or 14.        “dr. nassar was not a doctor,” she said in a statement read for her by a prosecutor. “he in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. end of story.”  the impact of the trial, and dr. nassar’s history of assault, is spreading well beyond the courtroom. michigan state university, which employed dr. nassar, was also facing increasing pressure after revelations that 14 people, including the president, lou anna k. simon,  had been warned about his conduct.   ms. raisman added that she had not been planning to speak in court — “i was scared and nervous,” she said — but decided to add her name to the list once she began listening to the impact statements that were delivered earlier this week.  “my dream,” she said, “is that one day everyone will know what the words ‘me, too’ signify, but they will be educated and able to protect themselves from predators like larry so that they will never, ever, ever have to say the words, ‘me, too.’ ”  the room filled with applause as ms. raisman thanked the judge and backed away from the microphone. more women were waiting their turn.

       " 'park city, utah — the protesting of racism and police brutality by american athletes started with w.n.b.a. players  at a news conference  in july 2016 and soon spread to the playing fields of the n.f.l. and the hardwood courts of the n.b.a. in less than five months, the winter games in pyeongchang, south korea, will present a far larger stage for demonstration: an olympic podium.  kehri jones, an olympic hopeful in bobsledding, was among those at an athlete summit here this week who said that athlete activism was something she had been thinking about and discussing with teammates as the pyeongchang games approach. the matter  intensified last weekend  after president trump disparaged n.f.l. players who had chosen to kneel during the national anthem in protest of police violence.  “i am an african-american woman and my family is all african-american,” said jones, who is from fort hood, tex. “i worry about my family and my siblings and my father going out and ending up in some of these awful situations,” she added, speaking of police brutality.  “it’s a really fine line i’m walking because my dad is in the military and i want to represent our country well,” jones continued. her father is scheduled to be deployed during the winter games. “but i also want to represent all the social injustice that has been going on.”        olympics officials and sponsors oppose political demonstrations in any form at the games, but that has not stopped some athletes. perhaps the most well-known instance of a political statement by american athletes was when the sprinters  tommie smith and john carlos  raised their fists in a black power salute at the 1968 mexico city games.  last summer, at the rio games, the  ethiopian marathoner feyisa lilesa  crossed his arms over his head at the finish line to protest ethiopia’s treatment of his ethnic group, the oromo people. he has been in exile since.  “at the olympic games themselves, there is a prohibition on all forms of demonstration, political or otherwise,” said scott blackmun, chief executive of the united states olympic committee, referring to a rule in the  olympic charter . “we have a little bit different state of play when it comes to the olympic games. but we certainly recognize the importance of athletes being able to express themselves.”  the american figure skater adam rippon is among the more outspoken olympic hopefuls in terms of politics, commonly sharing his views on  instagram  and twitter. over the weekend, after president trump said stephen curry and the golden state warriors were no longer invited to the white house, rippon  retweeted a statement  from the warriors, calling the team “champions on and off the court.”        “as athletes, we have a very unique opportunity to speak up about things that we believe in and to be that voice for people who are not being heard,” rippon said.  when asked if he would make some kind of statement at the olympics if he makes the podium, he hesitated. “i hope by the time the olympics comes around the atmosphere and tensions of the political climate are different,” he said, adding that he would support teammates should they express their views.  elana meyers taylor, a two-time olympic bobsledder, said athletes were pushing for social change more than ever before. “i think the hardest thing is that all of us would love to just stick to sports — but if you want us to be role models to kids then you need to stand for more than just sports.”            image     elana meyers taylor, left, a two-time olympic bobsledder, said if athletes are supposed to be role models, they cannot “stick to sports.”     credit  doug mills/the new york times         “at the end of the day,” she added, “the only time we hear the national anthem is when we win a gold medal. so we have to get to the olympics, then win a gold medal and then see what kind of social impact we can have there.”  while some athletes left open the possibility of making a political statement at the winter games, others said it was out of the question.  “you won’t see me taking a knee at the national anthem, especially at an event like the olympics,” said troy terry, a hockey player hoping to make the united states team for pyeongchang.

       " 'asheville, n.c. — we rule out more major moments and tennis titles at our peril. serena williams has proved that point many times over as she has returned from illness, injuries and other turmoil to keep winning the big ones.  coming back at age 36 from pregnancy and a difficult delivery, after more than a year away, is a new challenge, perhaps her biggest.  “tennis players have come back after pregnancy and succeeded, yes, but not at this age,” said her coach, patrick mouratoglou. “all the ones who did it were 10 years younger.”  but as williams practiced on friday, it was clear from courtside that the desire is still there, even if her fitness, lateral movement and timing have quite a ways to go.        “there’s been a lot of ups and downs in the practice,” williams said on the eve of the united states’ first-round fed cup match here against the netherlands. “i think that’s normal for everything that i’ve gone through. but it also gives me another view. it’s almost relaxing for me because i have nothing to prove. again, just fighting against all odds to be out there, to be competing again.”  she last played an official match on jan. 28, 2017, when she beat her sister venus williams  to win the australian open  without dropping a set in the tournament.  even after friday’s draw, it was unclear whether she would make her comeback here in singles or doubles (or both). she was not in the singles lineup for the opening-day matches on saturday. instead, venus williams and coco vandeweghe were listed to play for the united states: williams against arantxa rus and vandeweghe against richel hogenkamp.  for now, serena williams is scheduled to play only doubles. she and lauren davis would be in the final match on sunday and would probably be meaningless in light of the teams’ relative strengths.  “we’re going to be like serena and stay in the moment,” kathy rinaldi, the united states fed cup captain, told me on friday. “tomorrow we know venus and coco are playing, and then we’ll make a decision each day like we normally do at fed cup. we don’t plan everything out. things happen, and we have to see how everyone is playing and everyone is feeling.”        saturday’s lineup will come as a surprise to the casual fans who cannot imagine serena williams, winner of an open-era record 23 grand slam singles titles, failing to get priority. but it makes sense in this unusual context.  venus williams, at no. 8, and vandeweghe, at no. 17, are the two highest-ranked players on the american team. both played full and deeply successful seasons in 2017 when serena was giving birth to her daughter, alexis olympia, and marrying alexis ohanian. vandeweghe also was the undefeated leader of the american team that  won the fed cup  in belarus in november.  for the first time since she was a teenager, serena williams has no ranking, which has not gone unnoticed. erik poel, the director of the dutch tennis federation, jokingly referred to that strange state of affairs at the official team dinner on thursday night as he talked about reasons for the heavily underdog dutch team to be optimistic.  “we were looking, and a certain s. williams didn’t even have a ranking,” poel said, acting as if that certain s. williams were an unknown player.  williams, who was sitting nearby, hunched forward in her chair and roared with laughter while rinaldi reached back and gave poel a high five.  but everyone at the tables in asheville and elsewhere knows full well what s. williams is capable of, and though it is difficult to imagine her getting back to her peak, who truly has the moxie to proclaim that she won’t resume being a champion?  “she’s coming back because she believes she can win, otherwise she wouldn’t be coming back,” mouratoglou said in a telephone interview from france this week. “it’s that simple.”        rinaldi was tossing balls and occasional advice to williams on friday as williams exchanged groundstrokes with vandeweghe during their practice session. williams crushed certain shots with customary power and precision but mistimed many others, muttering to herself and shadow-stroking between rallies.  she was in a playful mood, dancing as she walked to the baseline and cracking jokes in her chair during breaks and between deep breaths, but she was all business between the lines.  “i’m sure she does want it to go faster,” rinaldi said of the process. “she’s got high expectations obviously, and it’s tough to manage those in the beginning and be patient with herself. but as you can see, i think that’s what makes her so great, too, is that she is tough on herself and has that drive. she wants to be back, wants to be playing and wants to be winning titles, it seems, and absolutely nobody knows how to do that better than she does.”  so what is reasonable in terms of expectations? a few months for williams to get her bearings, drop some more weight and potentially pose a threat at wimbledon in july? or something more ambitious?  “i wouldn’t be surprised if she steps back into it and does well, to be honest with you,” rinaldi said. “i’ve seen her this week, and every day she’s better and stronger, and the desire is there.”  olympia, now five months old, is here in asheville with williams, who experienced complications after giving birth by emergency cesarean section in september. she has said she spent the first six weeks of motherhood in bed. after her wedding in november, williams resumed training in earnest in december, a few weeks before she played and  lost a lucrative exhibition match  to jelena ostapenko in abu dhabi on dec. 30.  ostapenko, the reigning french open champion, kindly stopped hitting many balls to the corners as the match progressed, and williams looked underwhelmed with her own play.        skipping last month’s australian open seemed a sage decision.  “she really started from zero, doing no physical work for months,” mouratoglou said. “after the pregnancy and the complications, at the beginning she could only do 30 minutes of crosscourt hitting. we couldn’t call it real training.”  mouratoglou said he planned to join williams next week in the united states to prepare for the tournament in indian wells, calif., in march. he anticipates her playing a limited schedule in 2018: indian wells, miami, rome, madrid, the french open, wimbledon, a hardcourt tournament in north america, the united states open and then, if she qualifies, the wta finals in singapore.  there is also the fed cup, for which she needs to make herself available for three ties in the next two and a half years in order to be eligible for the 2020 summer olympics in tokyo.  “she can’t do seasons like 2013 or 2014,” mouratoglou said. “in 2013, she won 11 tournaments. that was herculean. she doesn’t have the same age, and i’m not sure she even wants that anymore. the focus for her will be on the big moments.”  that means the majors, where she is one championship away from tying margaret court’s record of 24 grand slam singles titles.  i asked williams on friday if winning no. 25 was the ultimate goal as she returns.  “right now, my main goal is just to stay in the moment,” she said. “it goes unsaid 25 is obviously something that i would love, but i’d hate to limit myself.”  consider that a warning to the rest of the women’s tour, where no single player has managed to dominate in williams’s extended absence. and consider it a sign that motherhood and marriage may have altered her perspective but have done nothing to lower her aim.

       " 'london — it was easy to feel sympathy for maria lasitskene, darya klishina and the other athletes from russia who won medals at the world track and field championships without the customary trappings.  they were in a form of limbo, not competing officially for their home country, which is still suspended because of a  widespread doping scandal .  instead they were here as “authorized neutral athletes,” which meant that they could only watch wistfully — and surely with some resentment — as their rivals wrapped their national flags around their shoulders and took their laps of honor.  “it’s sad when it’s your first medal from the world championships, and you see the girls who are running with the flags, and you can’t do anything because of the rules,” said klishina, a silver medalist in the long jump on friday behind brittney reese of the united states.        still, it is important to put the pity in perspective and give credit where it is due. track and field’s still-beleaguered and once-discredited governing body, the international association of athletics federations, has made so many wrong calls and choices in its modern history. its former president lamine diack is facing charges of corruption in france.  but the i.a.a.f. had the collective guts  to suspend the russian athletics federation  in 2015 and then, more surprisingly, to  maintain that ban  for the olympics last summer in rio de janeiro, despite considerable pushback. since then, the i.a.a.f. has had the resolve to stick with the decision until the russian reform process comes much closer to running its course.  this is all the more laudable because no other international sports federation has seen fit to follow suit, although the paralympic movement has also maintained  its russian ban .  it has made for quite a contrast this summer. in budapest last month at the world aquatics championships, the russian team was officially present and finished third in  the medal count  with 25. it heard its national anthem repeatedly, as 11 of the medals were gold.  “that’s swimming; we are athletics,” sebastian coe, the president of the i.a.a.f., said in an interview last week, using the international term for track and field. “we made a decision that we felt was in the best interests of the sport, and one thing i’m genuinely pleased about is that i believe we are making progress, and i don’t think we would have made that progress had we not taken a tough stance in the first place. and having neutral athletes here is a sign of progress.”        nineteen russian athletes competed in london, having become eligible by establishing that they had been subject to credible and consistent testing.  that does not make the reality on the ground any less odd. klishina was the only russian track athlete authorized to participate in the rio games, but she still competed for the russian olympic team.  in london, the russians taking part as authorized neutral athletes, or a.n.a.s, competed with shoe-company logos on their uniforms but no russian logos. and when lasitskene, the only a.n.a. gold medalist and the first neutral athlete ever to win at the worlds, stood atop the podium on saturday night, the anthem that was played to honor her victory in the women’s high jump was the official anthem of the i.a.a.f.  “i wanted to hear the anthem of my country today, but we’ll have a chance in the future,” lasitskene, who missed the rio olympics because of the ban, said in an interview with russian reporters. “i won’t spend my energy discussing this issue. a lot was already spent on it. there is a result, and this is what matters.”  clearly, there was no confusion in russia about which nation had won the women’s high jump, but the message is unmistakable internationally. russia, in at least one major sports domain, remains rightfully a pariah.  before these championships, thomas bach, the international olympic committee president, called the i.a.a.f.’s decision to maintain the ban “courageous.” it remains unclear whether bach’s organization will demonstrate the same character trait when it comes to next year’s winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea.  beckie scott, a former cross-country skier from canada who is chairwoman of the athletes commission in the world anti-doping agency, has said that fining the russians would not be enough in light of the evidence of state-sponsored doping documented in the  2016 mclaren report , which confirmed a huge cheating scheme at the 2014 winter games in sochi, russia.        two i.o.c. reports on the russians are due this year. bach says no decision will be made until all the evidence is in. coe declined to offer any advice. and the i.a.a.f. sticks to its own path.  “i didn’t describe it as courageous,” coe said of the i.a.a.f. move. “i just said it was a tough decision. i think it was a brave decision, but we didn’t do it on the basis that we were looking to be benchmarked. we did it because we genuinely believed it was in the right interest of our sport.”  it could be said that the federation had no real choice at first, not with the wada investigation into the russians initially  focused exclusively on track and field . coe said that in november 2015, the month of the russian ban, “i’m not sure i had a single sponsor that hadn’t either left or was heading for the hills, so that was quite a tricky moment.”  but the i.a.a.f. has certainly had a choice on whether to stick with the ban this long.  did coe expect the i.a.a.f. to be a lone wolf?  “i’ve often been a lone wolf,” he said. “that’s not an unusual place for me to be. people who deliver and contribute tend to be lone wolves occasionally, and you live with that.”  it is still hard to believe that coe, a longtime vice president at the i.a.a.f. before he was elected president in 2015, had no direct or indirect knowledge of the corruption diack is accused of. but that is the story coe is standing by.  coe is also showing some of the same persistence and staying power that he did when he was setting middle-distance records and defying pressure from margaret thatcher, then the prime minister of britain, to boycott the 1980 moscow olympics.        “there has been real change,” said andreas thorkildsen, a norwegian former star who won world and olympic titles in the javelin and is now part of the i.a.a.f. athletes commission. “i wouldn’t still be involved if i didn’t believe in what seb is doing.”  the ban on russia, a big country with a long history of track and field success, comes at a cost. at this stage, the i.a.a.f., as it fights for relevance and audience share globally, needs all the major markets it can get.  that includes the united states, whose 30 medals in london were its most in a world championships and led the medal count by a huge margin  —  a reflection of russia’s fall and jamaica’s struggles. but the sport remains a niche diversion in the states. not so in britain, where nearly 10 million watched bbc coverage on saturday night and where the championships set an attendance record, with more than 705,000 tickets sold over the 10 days.  the legacy of the 2012 olympics here played a role. so did the british taste for major sports events and the combined star power of usain bolt and britain’s mo farah, who were bidding a form of farewell (bolt plans to retire, farah to shift to road racing).  but replicating the packed stands and nightly buzz of london in doha, qatar, at the next world championships in 2019 is probably going to be too much to ask. russian athletes will surely be there. will russia?  “i hope it doesn’t take another year or two,” coe said. “but i haven’t ever put a time frame on this. it will be when the task force comes back to our i.a.a.f. council and says, ‘this is what we set out to do; these are the changes they have met.’ and it will be for the council to decide.”  for now, the only runners who can win races at the world championships with “russia” on their clothing are people like vladimir ivanov, a russian journalist in london who finished first in one of the heats of the news media race.

       " 'lima, peru — the first group of russian athletes suspected of being part of the country’s sophisticated doping program at the 2014 sochi games may soon face the prospect of banishment from the olympics, an official leading an investigation for the international olympic committee said on friday.  denis oswald, a swiss member of the i.o.c.’s executive board who heads one of two investigations into russian doping, told committee members at an annual meeting here in lima that he expected an investigation to conclude by the end of the year and that he expected athletes to be penalized. they could be stripped of medals and barred from the olympic games.  “we feel we have found a number of elements to charge a certain number of athletes,” oswald said.  such sanctioning of russian athletes might revive the shadow that hung over the country’s olympic team last year, when news of the doping scheme surfaced and led to a number of sports federations’ barring russian athletes from the rio games.  at the sochi games, russia was suspected of tampering with urine samples that would have failed antidoping examinations.        oswald said the lag in testing sochi samples stemmed from a difficulty coming up with a suitable method of detecting whether bottles — previously considered tamper-proof — had been manipulated.  “in a few days we will have the results of the first 50 bottles, and then we can proceed,” he said.  the scale and audaciousness of russian doping was unveiled last year when an investigator for the world anti-doping agency, richard mclaren, laid out how it worked, shortly before the rio games. his report used forensic analysis to corroborate the testimony of the former chief of russia’s national antidoping lab, grigory rodchenkov, who described how he and russia’s intelligence service had helped the nation’s olympians use banned, performance-enhancing substances throughout the sochi games.  mclaren’s report — which focused on russian doping schemes beyond sochi — identified about 1,000 athletes. early indications suggest that proving wrongdoing by some implicated athletes is likely to be difficult. the world anti-doping agency has  cleared 95  of the first 96 athletes whose cases of doping in competitions have been reviewed.  the amount of evidence on individual athletes varies widely, and sports officials have been directed to seek out additional evidence to bolster prosecutions.        before the rio games, doubts about which athletes would be participating continued right up to the eve of the event.  the i.o.c.’s president, thomas bach, has long favored “individual justice” over collective responsibility, and he left the decision about russia’s participation in rio to individual sports federations. some, like cycling, rowing and track and field, adopted blanket bans, while others allowed athletes who could prove they were clean to participate.  no winter sports federation has supported a total ban of russian athletes at the coming winter games in pyeongchang, south korea, a position that the majority of i.o.c. members in lima seemed to share.  “for me, the important thing is that the innocent athletes have got to be there,” said tunku imran, the i.o.c. member for malaysia.  any possible penalty against russia will have to wait until the completion of a wider report on russian doping by samuel schmid, a former president of switzerland.  russia remains confident of taking a full contingent of athletes to pyeongchang.  “it will be a russian team with the russian anthem and russian flag,” alexander zhukov, the head of the russian olympic committee, told reporters.  russia has denied that there was a state-backed conspiracy to cheat, something that it is required to acknowledge as part of a rehabilitation plan set out by the world anti-doping agency.        yet, moments after zhukov again denied the existence of a national plot to cheat, the president of wada, craig reedie, suggested some kind of admission was likely to come soon.  “alexander is very well aware of it, and in these situations it’s down to words,” reedie said.  the russian case has created tensions within the clean-sport movement. this week, a group of 17 national antidoping agencies published a letter demanding that russia be excluded from pyeongchang.  “the failure to expeditiously investigate individual russian athlete doping poses a clear and present danger for clean athletes worldwide and at the 2018 winter games,” said the letter, which had signatories that included the united states and british antidoping agencies.  reedie called the criticisms “unhelpful and backward looking.”       ',\n",
       " 'london — katerina stefanidi, a greek pole-vaulter and former stanford university star, competed in only one event at the world track and field championships this month. she won the gold.  but when she and her husband, mitchell krier, boarded their plane out of london on friday, they left with two medals in their baggage: one for her, one for him.  krier is also stefanidi’s coach, and for the first time in the history of these championships,  coaches are receiving medals, too .  they are not getting their moment on the podium, at least not yet, and they are not receiving prize money of their own. but they are getting something tangible.        “i am for recognizing coaches,” stefanidi said friday. “i think it’s necessary, a good first step, and i think we can do better in the future.”            image     katerina stefanidi of greece celebrated her gold medal in the pole vault with her husband and coach, mitchell krier.   credit  kevin coombs/reuters         the olympic games do not award medals to coaches, but numerous professional events do, including soccer’s premier club competitions like the champions league. zinedine zidane has winner’s medals as a coach and a player for real madrid. but not every coach cherishes the spoils of victory, or defeat.  on tuesday, after manchester united’s manager, josé mourinho, received his runner-up medal when his club lost the uefa super cup final to real madrid, mourinho  handed the medal to a young boy  wearing a united shirt in the front row before leaving the stadium.  “sometimes when i win, i don’t keep the medals, so imagine when i lose,” mourinho said at the postmatch news conference.        in north america, super bowl and world series rings go not only to players but also to the coaching staff and often other support personnel.  but the olympic world has remained resistant to formalizing the concept until now, and there are hints of a trend. philippe starck, the french designer, has created prototype medals for the 2024 summer olympics, which is now  all but certain to be staged in paris .  the medals come in the usual gold, silver and bronze, but can be divided into four parts, allowing the athlete, if he or she wishes, to give sections to others. coaches would presumably be high on the priority list.          “now more than ever, we don’t win alone,” starck said in  a video  posted by the paris 2024 bid organization. “this is a really good reward for team spirit.”  renaud lavillenie, the french men’s pole-vaulter and world-record holder, provided confirmation that the demand is there by draping his own bronze medal from these championships around his sleeping 4-week-old daughter, iris, and  posting the photo on twitter  with the caption “the reason for my happiness.”          the united states olympic committee already has a medal ceremony to honor its olympic and paralympic coaches. the medal was established before the 2008 games in beijing, and the u.s.o.c. calls it the  order of ikkos , named for the first recorded olympic coach in ancient greece (he coached the pentathlon long before it went modern).        medal-winning athletes from the united states may acknowledge one coach, and the u.s.o.c. ceremonies traditionally take place at usa house. the medals awarded are not official olympic medals.  the coaches’ medals awarded at the world track championships in london are official, coming directly from the organizers. they are a smaller version of the medals presented to the athletes, and are made of brass.  “it looks the exact same, just mini; it probably should be bigger,” said christian coleman, the american silver medalist in the men’s 100 meters.  coleman, competing in his first world championships, said he was unaware of the decision to award coaches medals but happily handed it to his coach, tim hall, after he was presented with it after his medal ceremony last sunday.  “he said, ‘coach, this one is for you,’ and i was like, ‘wait, what?’” hall said. “it was an interesting twist, and it was very appreciated. i will cherish it for a long time. it’s his first international medal, and it’s mine as well.”  it will likely not be coleman’s or hall’s last in london; coleman and the united states 4x100-meter relay team are heavily favored to finish among the top three on saturday night, when coleman will get the chance to beat usain bolt of jamaica for the third time in three races in bolt’s farewell meet.        “i mean, that would be pretty special, pretty crazy actually,” coleman said.  other coaches are already guaranteed multiple medals here. edrick floréal’s hurdlers are having quite a meet, with omar mcleod of jamaica winning gold in the men’s 110 hurdles and kori carter of the united states winning gold in the women’s 400 hurdles. floréal also coaches keni harrison, the world-record holder in the women’s 100 hurdles, who hit the first hurdle in her semifinal friday night but recovered to squeak into the final as the last qualifier.  “if you think about it, how many athletes would reach a medal stand without a coach?” floréal said. “the good ones are really life coaches. it’s not just running around teaching how to hurdle or do stride patterns.”  but while floréal said he appreciated the gesture by the london organizing committee and track and field’s governing body, the international association of athletics federations, he still felt some of its priorities were not in order.  “i think there’s an underlying slap in the face for coaches in that something as simple as getting access to the warm-up track to talk to an athlete means you have to jump through 9,000 hoops and get a pass and then pass it on to someone else when you’re done,” he said. “meanwhile, it seems like all the agents are getting a pass from the i.a.a.f. its like the agents are more valued than the people actually getting athletes to perform. there has to be a shift. i think it’s senseless.”  there is also the argument, not unreasonable in light of track and field’s long history of doping violations, that giving medals to coaches only means there will be two to return instead of one after an infraction. should coaches be so honored considering the role some have played in some of the sport’s biggest scandals? (see trevor graham, former coach to marion jones and justin gatlin.)  “you don’t want to treat everybody as an inmate because a bunch of people are thieves,” floréal said. “you put the law in place to punish criminals, but i think coaches should be given the benefit of the doubt.”  while stefanidi said she supported recognizing coaches, she said that if the i.a.a.f. continued the practice there should be an attempt to make the presentation more formal. now, she said, it feels like an afterthought to be handed the coach’s medal away from the spotlight.        “to get a medal from some random person in some room where you’re trying to get your pass and go, it’s not emotional enough,” she said.  her suggestion: allow coaches on the podium after the national anthem to spend a moment with their athletes, when they can receive their coaches’ medals and be recognized publicly. “it would only add a minute or so to the ceremony, and i think it would mean a lot more,” she said.  but other athletes in london seemed delighted with the new state of affairs. jenny simpson, the american 1,500-meter runner who won a silver medal here against a deep and daunting field, gave her coach, heather burroughs, a huge hug shortly after the race, shouting, “i did everything you said!”  she then raced off to do more interviews, only to return at full speed a few minutes later.  “heather! heather!” simpson shouted. “you get a medal! did you know that?”       ',\n",
       " 'track and field’s global governing body — the sports organization that has most forcefully disciplined russia for state-sponsored doping — said on monday that its computer network had been compromised by the same russian cyberespionage group that american intelligence officials have tied to a broad effort to influence the united states presidential election. the hackers were able to gain access to athletes’ private medical records, the track and field body said.  the international association of athletics federations, the sport’s ruling body, said it had discovered the attacks on feb. 21. it attributed them to fancy bear, a group that stole records from global antidoping regulators last year, after the regulator recommended that russia be barred from the 2016 summer olympics. intelligence officials and forensics experts have linked fancy bear to russia’s military intelligence agency.  the i.a.a.f said on monday that it had consulted with the authorities in britain and monaco, where the organization has its headquarters, and secured its network in recent days.  “our first priority is to the athletes who have provided the i.a.a.f. with information that they believed would be secure and confidential,” sebastian coe, the i.a.a.f. president, said in a statement, noting that all athletes who had filed medical records since 2012 had been informed. “they have our sincerest apologies and our total commitment to continue to do everything in our power to remedy the situation.”        last year, fancy bear  hacked the athlete database  of the world anti-doping agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports,  as well as the email account  of an employee of the united states anti-doping agency. both organizations had recommended that russia be barred from the 2016 olympics over  elaborate cheating  at the previous games.  through the end of 2016, fancy bear published the confidential medical information of more than 100 athletes — predominately from britain and the united states — as well as the emails of antidoping officials from the united states and canada. as of monday afternoon, no new information had been published to the site, titled #opolympics.  both the hackers and russian sports officials have argued that the stolen records show that western athletes have received unfair advantages through so-called therapeutic-use exemptions, or special waivers to take drugs that are typically banned.  any athlete can apply for such a waiver, requesting permission, for example, to use an inhaler or take a medication to treat attention-deficit disorders. global antidoping and sports officials have denounced the disclosures, emphasizing that none of the implicated athletes had done anything wrong and that all had sought proper permissions.  in january, in a  declassified intelligence report  focused on the united states election, american intelligence officials said that fancy bear’s intrusions into the world anti-doping agency had originated with g.r.u., the russian military intelligence agency also involved in the  theft of emails and documents  from the democratic national committee. the officials suggested that the russian state had been motivated by revenge.        “putin publicly pointed to the panama papers disclosure and the olympic doping scandal as u.s.-directed efforts to defame russia, suggesting he sought to use disclosures to discredit the image of the united states and cast it as hypocritical,” the report said, referring to the russian president, vladimir v. putin.  the i.a.a.f. was among the first and most forceful in disciplining russia for systematic doping, suspending the nation in 2015 and  voting last summer  to bar russia from the rio olympics. only one russian track and field athlete, who had been living and training in the united states, was permitted to compete.  russia remains barred from global track and field competitions and  appears set to miss this summer’s world championships  in london. sports officials have suggested that november may be the soonest the nation is restored to good standing.  as russian officials have broadly apologized for doping problems, they have also regularly referred to fancy bear’s stolen information.  “russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,” vitaly smirnov, a former top russian sports official appointed by mr. putin to reform the nation’s antidoping system,  told the new york times  in moscow in december, referring to the world anti-doping agency’s hacked records as evidence. “the general feeling in russia is that we didn’t have a chance.”       ',\n",
       " 'many of the world’s winter athletes, now preparing for the season’s championship events, are frustrated with the response of sports officials to the russian doping scandal and are wondering why implicated russian olympians still turn up at the starting line.  hundreds of athletes from dozens of nations have signed petitions, threatened to boycott major events and called for sports authorities to act on evidence that the urine samples of dozens of russian athletes were tampered with to conceal widespread doping at the last winter olympics, in sochi, russia, in 2014.  russian athletes implicated in the sochi cheating have continued to compete, and none have been disqualified by the international olympic committee, as officials continue further inquiries of their own.  “we will not sacrifice a full and thorough investigation that will be legally scrutinized simply to speed up the process,” mark adams, a spokesman for the olympic committee, said tuesday.        revelations of russia’s doping schemes have compelled olympic officials to expand their retesting of summer olympians — which have so far resulted in sanctions against dozens of athletes — but their scrutiny has not affected many winter athletes so far.  the association of international olympic winter sports federations cited four major competitions that had been moved out of russia for the 2016-17 season after an  outcry from athletes , including the cross-country skiing world cup finals and the bobsled and skeleton world championships.  accused russian athletes have continued to participate in those competitions, the winter sports organization said, because of “the presumption of innocence, the right to be heard and due process.”  responding to a petition signed by more than 150 athletes, global officials for biathlon will meet in austria on wednesday, ahead of that sport’s world championships, to discuss the doping scandal and broader disciplinary policy. prominent athletes, including the french biathlon champion martin fourcade, a winner of two gold medals at sochi, had threatened to skip the competition unless officials addressed their concerns.  the athletes have called for stricter penalties for drug violations — including longer bans of up to eight years and higher fines of up to 1 million euros — while also asking that officials, in scrutinizing the accused russian athletes, balance thoroughness with speed in order to preserve the integrity of this year’s competitions.        “given the unprecedented and urgent nature of the current situation,” the athletes wrote, “we do not have time to wait” until 2018, when biathlon’s full leadership is next due to convene formally.  the biathlon officials are also expected to vote this week on moving the 2021 world championships out of russia. the competition was assigned to the nation in the fall, after the international olympic committee had expressly directed sports officials not to award new events to russia in light of the doping scandal.  should the biathlon officials decline to move the event, the world anti-doping agency could impose a penalty, possibly threatening the sport’s place at the 2018 winter olympics, in pyeongchang, south korea.  russia’s national team itself could face disciplinary action ahead of the 2018 games, something some antidoping officials have called a parallel punishment for systemic cheating at the last winter olympics.  as olympic officials review the  evidence delivered  late last year by the world anti-doping agency and an independent investigator, the canadian lawyer richard h. mclaren, they are considering not just the individual cases across sports but what collective punishment may be warranted in light of the russian government’s involvement.  much of mr. mclaren’s evidence was made public on a website, with individual names redacted. the identities of the implicated athletes were shared privately with sports officials, although some sports organizations have called the evidence insufficient.        “in some cases, provisional suspensions have had to be lifted and procedures dropped due to a lack of evidence currently provided by wada to issue sanctions able to stand up to legal challenge,” the winter sports organization said in a statement.  wada, the antidoping regulator, is scheduled to meet with the winter sports organizations this month to discuss the evidence.  meanwhile, athletes are considering the implications of sanctions. katie uhlaender, an american skeleton racer who placed fourth in sochi, has  wondered for months  if she will inherit an olympic medal, after learning that the russian athlete who placed third in that competition, elena nikitina, was among those whose urine sample was manipulated.  uhlaender has faced nikitina in competition several times in the last month alone, after bobsled and skeleton officials lifted a provisional suspension on implicated russian athletes. investigations into those cases are continuing, those officials said.  “the i.o.c. needs to step up,” uhlaender said. “the mclaren report seems very clear: there was tampering. all i’m asking for is an even playing field. if you let someone get away with something, why wouldn’t they just continue doing it? why wouldn’t others do it?”  few olympic sports have taken such strong action on the issue as track and field, which  voted unanimously  monday to keep the ban on russia in place until the nation demonstrated change and fulfilled specific conditions.       ',\n",
       " 'london — russia will miss an end-of-year deadline to turn over data on its athletes to the global regulator of drugs in sports, raising the specter of new penalties arising from a broad, state-supported cheating scandal in international competitions.  as a condition of lifting penalties that had largely barred russia from hosting or participating in a range of international events because of cheating, it had pledged in september to deliver data from its corrupted antidoping laboratory to the regulator, the world anti-doping agency.  that data would conclusively prove which of its athletes had been doping as part of the state-sanctioned program that marred several major sporting events, including the olympic games.  yet missing the deadline means russia has failed to comply with wada’s request, putting pressure on the agency to reinstate the penalties, which a range of athletes and critics had said should have been maintained in the first place.        the back-and-forth over the data has demonstrated russia’s strength and, to a number of those who support clean sport, wada’s weakness. the agency did not comment monday, but officials privately have accepted russia would miss the deadline.  “the world is watching,” callum skinner, a british olympic cyclist, wrote on twitter. “this is huge for athlete welfare and clean sport.”          a team from the montreal-based antidoping organization sent to moscow to retrieve the data returned empty-handed after russian authorities, citing local regulations, refused to clear the equipment they had brought to the country. wada said russia had not questioned the equipment at a meeting to prepare for the event.  russian officials have said they have now cleared the team to re-enter the country, a visit that if carried out would fall beyond the deadline but before a critical meeting on jan. 14, when wada’s compliance review committee will make a recommendation to its board over what action should be taken.        should russia not be punished for missing the deadline, wada’s growing army of critics, including the united states anti-doping agency and a new movement of predominantly western athletes, is likely to sharpen its attacks.            image     the use of “olympic athlete from russia” for athletes allowed to compete from that country was criticized as undermining a ban for doping.   credit  james hill for the new york times         “the situation is a total joke and an embarrassment for wada and the global anti-doping system,” travis tygart, the chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency, said as news that the deadline would be missed circulated. “no one is surprised this deadline was ignored and it’s time for wada to stop being played by the russians and immediately declare them non-compliant for failing yet again to meet the deadline. we hold athletes strictly accountable, so states that intentionally rob clean athletes and corrupt the olympic values should also be held accountable.”  russia had not fulfilled all the criteria wada had initially demanded before it was reinstated to international sport in september. the agency’s officials believed then that a new pathway that included the commitment to provide the data by a set deadline would help russia move past scandal and finally identify the athletes — likely in the hundreds — who benefited from the doping program.  the missed deadline will also be the latest humiliation for wada’s embattled president, craig reedie. last month, reedie, a british sports official and a member of the international olympic committee, said that it was “inconceivable” that russia would miss the deadline.  sebastian samuelsson, an olympic silver medal winner in biathlon, said on twitter on monday that wada’s decision to reinstate russia’s doping agency, known as rusada, in september without all criteria met was “a devastating blow for athletes.”          “it is important wada starts protecting clean athletes and not cheaters,”  samuelsson said . “if not i have a hard time to even see a future for wada.”        new rules adopted in april mean sanctions for failure to comply are much clearer now than they were when russia’s doping program was first unmasked. sports federations, many reliant on russian largess, will not have flexibility in deciding which measures they can take.  the potential scale of a looming punishment has rattled russian antidoping officials who, at least publicly, appear to be at odds with the government over how to handle the situation. last week, rusada’s head, yuri ganus, pleaded with president vladimir v. putin to bring an end to the crisis, and issued a warning that russia is “on the brink of abyss.”  “i ask you to protect the present and future of our fair sport, present and future generations of athletes,” ganus said in a video message to putin, who continues to deny the cheating scandal was orchestrated by the state.  the missing data is essential to crosscheck leaked details sent to wada with profiles of about 10,000 suspicious doping samples from russia. the underlying data that wada hopes to extract from russia will show how many of those 10,000 cases will lead to athletes having cases to answer.  some wada officials are privately concerned that russia could succeed with an appeal to the court of arbitration for sport if the ban is reimposed.  “are you going to declare them noncompliant if they are compliant?” said a person familiar with the matter.

       " 'mina guli demurs when someone has the audacity to call her a runner.  “i feel like i’m not an athlete,” she said via skype from a hotel room in shanghai. “a runner? i’m not that, either.”  she had just run a marathon that day, and was about to run another one the next day, then another the day after that, and after that. her goal: to run 100 marathons in 100 days to raise awareness of global water issues.  these are not official marathons, of course, but 26.2-mile runs that she mapped out and then documented with photos on twitter, where #runningdry became a thing in running circles.        how can she afford this?  guli, 48, is part of a class of runners now picking up sponsorships the same way top-level runners coming out of college do. they won’t be winning the boston marathon or olympic medals, but they offer something that shoe brands want to be a part of at a time when the top of the podium isn’t the only spotlight.            image     guli with supporters during a run in central park.    credit  james keivom for the new york times         guli is sponsored by reebok,  which gives her gear, a media campaign around her quest and, maybe most important of all, for the logistics of her quest, money. she is not entirely an unknown — she is the founder and chief executive of thirst, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the global water crisis — but she is hardly a social media star. her instagram account has just over 3,000 followers, a pittance in the influencer world.  in other words, reebok isn’t just throwing products at runners in exchange for pretty pictures on their instagram feeds.  rather,  reebok and other companies are going after unique narratives they hope will inspire people. they&#x27;re doing this at a time when participants are as likely to be influenced by what someone who looks like them is wearing as the runner who ends up with a gold medal.  “ultimately, they want to be able to tell a story,” said merhawi keflezighi, founder and president of hawi management, which represents athletes like his brother meb, the long-distance runner, and the paralympic sprinter jarryd wallace.  meb keflezighi was second in the olympic marathon in 2004 in athens, and won the new york city marathon in 2009 and boston in 2014. merhawi keflezighi has been an agent since 2005, and seen the types of sponsorship deals widen in that time. “people can relate to others when it’s not just the fastest person in the world or the strongest person in the world,” he said.        case in point,  justin gallegos, a runner with cerebral palsy whose video of getting a contract from nike went viral . “people admired that passion that he has for running,” merhawi keflezighi said.          gallegos first connected with nike in high school. at the university of oregon, where he ran for a club team, he worked with nike on the development of the  flyease shoe , which is designed for athletes with mobility impairments. getting the nike offer caught gallegos off guard, though he did know it was a possibility. his manager, john truax, is also a nike employee.  “i think it puts a statement on what being an athlete truly means,” gallegos said. “yes, talent is important. don’t get me wrong. but you can have all the talent in the world and not have any passion.”  gallegos is now planning to run his first marathon — he wants it to be the chicago marathon in october. he is campaigning for more runners with cerebral palsy to run longer distances at the 2020 summer paralympics in tokyo. he would like to run the 1,500-meter race, but said  that the standards for it right now are not achievable for someone with cerebral palsy.  “it’s important for these companies to expand their horizons because there’s lots and lots of talented athletes out there,” he added.  while nike and reebok assisted in arranging interviews with their athletes, neither company responded to follow-up requests to comment on why they chose to sponsor such runners.        mirna valerio, 43, started a blog called, “ fat girl running ,” in 2011 while training for her first marathon. she named it that “because i was fat and i was a girl and i ran,” she said. “it’s as simple as that. i knew that it would be a little controversial, and i was o.k. with that.”          she has since run the javelina jundred 100k in arizona and the six-day, 120-mile version of the transrockies run in colorado. she also wrote a memoir, “a beautiful work in progress.”  while none of the runners interviewed for this article would share how much these contracts were worth because of nondisclosure agreements, valerio said being sponsored was enough for her to quit her teaching job and run full time. she said she was able to do so with the financial support of merrell, skirt sports, hyland’s, swiftwick and custom performance of new york.  “she’s got a passion for being outside and testing and challenging herself and her own evolution and development of someone who’s passionate about the outdoors,” strick walker, chief marketing officer of merrell, said.  valerio said the support for nonelite runners had been a long time coming, though she understood that like all businesses, the companies were investing in everyday runners because they thought that doing so could make them money.  “they’re realizing that their bottom line can be enhanced by including more people, including different communities,” she said. “they will say it’s about inclusivity, but when you get down to it, it’s about your bottom line and market share, and you don’t want to lose market share by not being inclusive.”            image         guli was scheduled to run her 100th marathon in 100 days in new york city on feb. 11, but she fractured the shaft of her right femur before she could get there.    credit  james keivom for the new york times         of course, just like the elites, everyday runners experience their own pitfalls, whether they have sponsorships or not. guli was scheduled to run her 100th marathon in 100 days in new york city on feb. 11, but  she fractured the shaft of her right femur  and could only run 62. the one in new york went on, anyway, with runners who she said had come out to raise awareness of the global water crisis, and she crossed the finish line, set up in central park, on crutches.  “i’m just a normal person who set out one day to make a difference in this world, and it turned out running was a way to make it happen,” she said.

       " \"they are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.  in college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the justice department has uncovered.  just like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. these slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.  the justice department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.        unlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.  that is more difficult to do in big sports. “in basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said corey evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at rivals, the recruiting website.   [several college coaches were named in the federal indictment tuesday.    read more about each of them.   ]   in short order tuesday, the sailing coach at stanford was fired. the u.c.l.a. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the wake forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the university of texas. j.b. bird, a university spokesman, said texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” the university stated it believed coach michael center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”             image     william rick singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won.   credit  katherine taylor for the new york times         the water polo coach at the university of southern california, jovan vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early tuesday morning in hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.        the practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.  stanford university said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. the acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in stanford’s history. no wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent massachusetts real estate developer john b. wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at stanford.  federal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.  at the heart of the scheme was william singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.  according to the indictment, singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. one student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.  kathy deboer, the executive director of the american volleyball coaches association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”  even fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. and there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”        meghan dubyak, a spokeswoman for georgetown university, said the university had fired its tennis coach, gordon ernst, in december 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. she did not provide details. ernst became the tennis coach at the university of rhode island last year. the university placed him on leave tuesday.            image

soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. relatives of that applicant paid mr. singer $1.2 million. the coach, rudy meredith, stepped down in november.  he told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”  a month later, he was elected to the connecticut soccer hall of fame. he led the bulldogs team to their first-ever n.c.a.a. tournament and first-ever unshared ivy league title. meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.  according to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in april 2018.  stanford university fired its head sailing coach, john vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.        “neither student came to stanford,” a statement from stanford said. “however, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to stanford’s values.”  no school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than u.s.c.  singer is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.  the central figure at u.s.c. is donna heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. the affidavit charges singer with depositing $1.3 million in u.s.c. accounts controlled by heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last july. she was fired tuesday.            image

making payments to a private school for vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.  ali khosroshahin, a former u.s.c.

daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.        in a letter, u.s.c.’s interim president wanda austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. it is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”  the case is only the latest to rock u.s.c. the school’s football program was hit with severe n.c.a.a. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to heisman trophy winning running back reggie

u.s.c. players to certain financial advisers.  prosecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between singer and augustin huneeus jr., a vineyard owner in northern california who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at u.s.c. in exchange for coach vavic securing his daughter’s admission.  “you understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” huneeus said of u.s.c.’s powerhouse water polo team.  “he knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” singer responded, referring to vavic.  later, he reassured huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”  “but she’s not,” huneeus said.       \",\n",
       " 'seoul, south korea — when the #metoo movement  started gaining traction  in south korea last year, many people looked to the country’s sports communities, which have long been dogged by  allegations of corruption  and physical abuse. but few victims spoke out.  that changed this month, when shim suk-hee, 21, a member of south korea’s national short-track speedskating team and a two-time olympic gold medalist, said she had been repeatedly raped by her former coach, cho jae-beom, since she was 17.  mr. cho, 38, was fired as national team coach shortly before the start of the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea, last year on allegations of violent abuse against athletes. in september, he was sentenced to 10 months in prison for physically assaulting four athletes, including ms. shim, between 2011 and the preparations for  the pyeongchang games .  if ms. shim’s accusation of sexual assault is corroborated, it would add more weight to the long-held allegation among sports analysts that south korea’s  glory in short-track speedskating  has been built on a brutal training regimen that included beatings and other forms of violence.        allegations of abuse against elite athletes are being addressed in other countries, including the united states, where  lawrence g. nassar , a former doctor for the women’s national gymnastics team, was sentenced last year to decades in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women.  mr. cho, speaking through his lawyers, denied raping ms. shim. the police said that they had confiscated his cellphone and computers to look for criminal evidence.  ms. shim’s accusations against her former coach have sent shock waves through the country’s sports community.        image     cho jae-beom, 38, was fired as national team coach last year on allegations of violent abuse. in september, he was sentenced to 10 months in prison for assaulting athletes, including ms. shim.   credit  yonhap       south korea is particularly  proud of its short-track speedskating . the country has won 24 olympic gold medals, more than any other country, since the sport became part of the games in 1992. ms. shim herself has won more than 20 gold medals in international competitions since 2012, including a gold in the 3,000-meter team relay at the 2014 winter olympics. she won the same medal in pyeongchang.        “this unveils the humiliating underside of our country’s glorious facade as a sports powerhouse,” president moon jae-in said on monday.  mr. moon called for a thorough investigation, urging his government to help other victims feel safe enough to speak out.  his remarks came as more than 260,000 people signed  a petition  to his office demanding a longer prison term for mr. cho.  mr. moon’s government was caught off guard by ms. shim’s allegations.  only hours before ms. shim’s accusations were first reported in the local news media last tuesday, the country’s korean sport and olympic committee reported making strong progress in its campaign to protect athletes against sexual and other types of abuse. in a survey of 1,201 athletes, including all 791 national team members, the committee said it had found only four cases of sexual violence. in a similar survey in 2010, almost 27 percent of respondents reported sexual abuse.  the government said it would open a more comprehensive investigation of sexual crimes in the sports community, vowing to expel perpetrators from the field permanently and to take steps to prevent schools and other teams from hiring them.  “one of the problems has been that the perpetrators were not properly punished and they often returned to their old jobs,” vice sport minister roh tae-kang said last week.  encouraged by ms. shim’s accusations, a former judo competitor, shin yoo-yong, 24, publicly accused her former coach of having repeatedly raped her since she was a high school student. her coach once tried to silence her with a $445 payoff after his wife began suspecting him of having a sexual relationship with her, ms. shin said in a facebook post and in an  interview  with the hankyoreh newspaper, published on monday.        the police said they were investigating the case.  solidarity for young skaters, a group of current and former ice skaters and coaches, said at least two other victims planned to speak in public. other victims of sexual violence were afraid to speak out because whistle-blowers in the past had been vilified and ostracized in their profession, which is ruled by a rigid, hierarchical relationship between coaches and athletes, said the group’s leader, yeo jun-hyung, a former national team coach.        image     ms. shim outside the suwon district court, south of seoul, the capital, in december.   credit  yonhap/agence france-presse — getty images       the government’s efforts to encourage whistle-blowers by opening hotlines for victims have not worked, critics said.  “if shim suk-hee were not an olympic gold medalist, her case too could have been buried,” chung yong-chul, a professor of sports psychology at sogang university in seoul, the south korean capital, said at a news conference last week.  sports experts had long said that abuse was widespread in south korea, where winning olympic golds justified physical assaults. in south korea, athletes often live together in dormitories and routinely skip other classes, leaving them with few other career choices. such a system gives coaches exceptional power over athletes, sports commentators say.  mr. cho, who had coached ms. shim since she was in primary school, regularly inspected her cellphone to see whom she was talking to, her lawyer, lim sang-hyuk, told reporters. when she was in the fourth grade, mr. cho broke a bone in her finger with a hockey stick, mr. lim said.  ms. shim could not protest this behavior because of fears that mr. cho would end her career, mr. lim said. the coach once tinkered with ms. shim’s skate blades in a competition to favor other athletes, mr. lim added.        ms. shim’s troubles first came to public attention last january, when she left the national team training facility in the run-up to the pyeongchang games because of physical abuse.  mr. cho was quickly removed as coach after an investigation. he was briefly hired to coach the chinese national team after he was banned from working in south korea, but he later returned home to face trial.  testifying at mr. cho’s appeals trial last month, ms. shim said mr. cho used to punch and kick her until “she felt she might die” during training for the pyeongchang games. ms. shim claimed that a fall she had during a pyeongchang competition was because of a concussion she had suffered at mr. cho’s hands.  “i came here so that there will be no more victims like me,” ms. shim said.

       " 'some of the world’s top biathletes descended this weekend on utah for the first time in 17 years. the return for a world cup event comes as salt lake city promotes its bid to host the 2030 olympics.  for armin auchentaller, the italian national who began overseeing the united states women’s team last spring, the needs are more immediate. biathlon, which combines nordic skiing and target shooting, is the only winter olympic sport in which team usa has never won a medal.  auchentaller’s job is to change that. in a recent phone interview from utah, where the team was preparing for competitions at soldier hollow, auchentaller cited his experience coaching the swiss biathlon team, which, like the united states, is not considered at the pinnacle of the sport. he said it had helped him understand how to take a team from nowhere to a place where where landing on an olympic podium is possible, as the swiss did in 2014.  here are edited excerpts from the interview with auchentaller.     you want to put an american on an olympic podium. were you an olympian?          i was good skier and good biathlete, but not good enough. but i was coaching with switzerland from 2014 to 2018, and we had good results. i built up the team there, because there wasn’t really much of a women’s team when i arrived. but by the end, we were able to get some results in the top 10.     what is the most important factor in creating a successful team here?   it’s not the successful sport here that it is in the european countries. we have just a few athletes, but those athletes we have, they are so committed and they have great personalities. the important thing is to work with them and get them better every single day.     did the top biathletes here grow up with the sport?   many of them were college cross-country skiers, and after they received their degree, they switched. so it’s very challenging to learn to shoot, to learn the game — what they can do, what they cannot do during a competition.     you could train me forever, and i would never be able to dunk a basketball or hit a 90-mile-per-hour fastball. can you teach someone to be a great shot?    everybody should have a little bit of talent to start. but it’s important to remember some of the great champions were not great shooters when they were young. i am convinced i can teach you shooting.           what is the hardest thing about shooting?   the most tricky thing is not technical, it’s the mental part, the emotional part, especially when it comes down to hit the last chart [target]. even the best biathletes, they have the technical qualities and skills, but the last shot is the hardest.     what americans have the best chance to get to a podium?    sean doherty on the men’s side. for the women, it’s susan dunklee and clare egan.     what is the key to their progress?    the main thing is try to be as consistent as possible. if you have too many ups and downs, the chances may be not as high, but if you are consistent, at some point you will get there. remember, in our sport, you can be in the lead, and if you miss on the last chart, instead of being on the podium, you can be 30th.     do u.s. biathletes have enough support?   we need even more private sponsors for the athletes to be able to pay their flights and other costs. the u.s.o.c. is our biggest sponsor, and we do have two or three minor sponsors, but we need the big ones especially to be able to develop the young athletes.     guns are very controversial in the united states, but they are popular with a large segment of the population. is that an advantage?    i definitely see it as an advantage. in the u.s., it can seem like everyone has a gun. we should use this, the popularity of these sport guns.     how is the fan support in the united states?   i wish it would it would be more popular in the u.s. if people get to know this sport, i know it will be very popular.

       " 'london — when kori carter took the track for her opening heat in the 400-meter hurdles at the world track and field championships monday, her coach, edrick floréal, sent her out with some untraditional instructions. go as hard as you can out of the blocks, floréal said, and then take a look around — or rather, up.  “my coach told me to get out the first six hurdles like it’s the final and then told me to be smart from there, check the screen so i knew where everyone was,” carter said.  in ways large and small, the two huge screens inside london stadium have become as much a part of the nightly action here as the runners wearing spikes. the monitors display the replays, the statistics and, most dramatically, the final results shortly after a tight finish, allowing runners huddled together on the track and gazing upward — chests heaving — to get clarity, and confirmation, from on high almost as soon as their races end.  but the screens also display live coverage of events in progress, and because the screens are positioned at opposite ends of the stadium — in the curves — the athletes running in either straightaway can get a high-definition look at the state of play if they choose to sneak a peek.        “it is kind of weird sometimes: it is like you’re trapped in a video game, but it’s awesome,” said sparkle mcknight, a women’s 400-meter hurdler from trinidad and tobago.  for 10 days at least, the 21st-century debate about screen time and exercise involves two items that are not mutually exclusive. carter, a hurdler from the united states who qualified for the final on tuesday night, acknowledged that she was among those who take full advantage of the video boards whenever practical. “i definitely use the screen,” she said.  floréal, her coach, said that the screens are particularly useful in the preliminary rounds.  “you don’t want to go out and run too fast unless you have to,” he said tuesday. “obviously, looking left and right to find out where everybody is can distract you, and with the screen you are always looking ahead, so you don’t have to do that.”            image     the american kori carter, second from right, said her coach told her to use the video boards to check on her competitors.   credit  martin meissner/associated press         but the screens also can be helpful as a real-time tool when medals are at stake.  on friday night, the british distance star mo farah looked up at the display at the start of the bell lap of the 10,000-meter final. farah was in the lead and wanted to get a better sense of where his rivals behind him were positioned. what he learned from a quick glance helped him hold off the chase pack and win his latest world title.        other distance runners who have not used the technology in the past have sometimes paid the price. during the final of the women’s 10,000 at the last world championships, in beijing in 2015, molly huddle of the united states was in the homestretch and in bronze medal position. she looked over her right shoulder, saw no trouble closing on the outside and eased up as she neared the finish line, raising her arms in celebration. as she did, she was passed on the inside by her american teammate emily infeld.          but the new-age tools are not suited to every occasion, including monday night’s manic, tightly packed finish to the women’s 1,500 meters, which faith kipyegon of kenya won after holding off late charges from jenny simpson of the united states and caster semenya of south africa. simpson ended up with the silver, her third medal in the 1,500 at a world championships. semenya took the bronze.  “i don’t watch the screen at all, because it can be a little bit delayed and the perspective can be strange,” simpson said. “and honestly, a race like tonight, i’m running as hard as i can, and it’s hard enough for me to stay lucid and make good decisions looking at everything going on in front of me.”  but simpson was coming from behind.  “if you’re in front, the screen may be the only data you get,” said simpson’s coach, heather burroughs. “i think there are races, particularly longer races or more tactical races, where it’s useful. but i think in a race like this 1,500, where the last 600 meters is so frenzied, you really can’t look at the screen without making a mistake.  “you’re more likely to make contact with someone, and it would take a while to kind of get perspective and positioning after looking at it,” burroughs said. “you would be at risk of missing some move that is made by failing to respond. things happen very, very quickly.”  the same is true of other events. there is simply not enough time for screen time in a 100-meter final, and even less in the sprint hurdles, where there are obstacles to clear every few strides.        “absolutely no using the screen — that would be a disaster,” said floréal, who also coaches the american keni harrison, the world-record holder in the 100 hurdles, and the jamaican omar mcleod, the reigning olympic champion. mcleod added another gold here in the 110 hurdles on monday night.  but the hurdlers in the 400 have more running and thinking room: 35 meters between obstacles. “still, i’d only advise it for professionals who have a keen sense of stride length and stride rate and exactly where they are on the racecourse,” said floréal, the head track and field coach at the university of kentucky.  he said video screens at many other venues are poorly positioned for in-race use, including the one at hayward field in eugene, ore.  “the n.c.a.a. screen at eugene is so much higher, so you have to take your eyes a little bit off the track and go 60 to 70 feet up,” he said. “whereas in london and all the world championships and olympics, the screens are typically directly in the middle of the turn and are so big you can see all the lanes.”  athletes in the field events in london also are taking advantage of the screens, just not while they are in the act of throwing or jumping. many use the displays to review their attempts, and they find the screens particularly useful considering that their access to other technology — ipads, laptops and even smartphones — is banned during competition.  “they are very strict here — you can’t get anything by them,” said joe kovacs, the american who won a silver medal in the men’s shot-put on sunday. “even an apple watch like i normally wear is not allowed, which is smart because you could have somebody texting you what to do.”        but kovacs and his coach can watch footage of his throws almost immediately after each attempt when they are replayed on the big screens, and then make in-competition adjustments.  will claye, one of the world’s best triple jumpers, said that he does the same. “it’s like we get to study our game film while the game is going on,” he said. “i definitely think it’s something that helps us all on the track, whether you are running the 10,000 and want to see what position you are in or you are throwing the shot and seeing where your rotation was wrong. it definitely helps us.”  humans remaining humans, though, there are other benefits of keeping an eye on the video screens.  “i look at the screen all the time,” said quanera hayes, an american 400-meter runner. “and that’s because i want to make sure i am looking good for the people back home.”

       " 'the world anti-doping agency’s executive committee  declined on monday  to punish russia’s antidoping watchdog even though the russian antidoping agency missed an end-of-year deadline to hand over data on 10,000 suspicious doping samples.  wada’s team in moscow was eventually allowed into the laboratory which held the data, and last week wada announced that the team had successfully obtained all data.  “collecting the all-important data is a critical step, and it was not easy to achieve,” craig reedie, wada’s president, said in a statement. “we are not yet at the finishing line and there is a lot more to do but undeniably we are much further along the track.”  the data, assuming it has not been tampered with, is key to getting to the roots of russia’s vast, decade-long conspiracy to corrupt the system of performance enhancing drug testing in international sports. the whistle blower grigory rodchenkov, the former leader of moscow’s antidoping lab, exposed the corruption in 2015.        in september, wada’s executive committee voted to  reinstate the russian antidoping agency , despite it not having yet met all of the conditions for reinstatement. that decision was  vociferously opposed  by athletes, and wada’s own vice president voted against it.  reedie added in the statement: “several members of the exco voiced their disappointment that the deadline had been missed but agreed that no sanction in that regard should be imposed.”  the executive committee’s decision followed a  recommendation  by wada’s influential compliance review committee that “no further action” was recommended. the recommendation says that noncompliance should be pursued only as a last resort, and in all cases if a “nonconformity” is corrected quickly, no sanction should be imposed.  “the critical point was to get the analytical data, and that has now happened,” wrote jonathan taylor, chair of the compliance review committee, in the recommendation.  wada also announced that an audit of the russian antidoping agency, another condition of continued reinstatement, was completed in early december with “very positive” results.        the next major step is for wada to confirm the authenticity of the 20 terabytes of data that was collected from the laboratory information management system and central backup servers. wada’s extraction team in moscow confirmed that the data can be opened and read, but not that every expected record is present and full.  that process is expected to take two to three months, and the compliance review committee will receive an update every two weeks. if the data is found to have been tampered with, the compliance review committee will meet immediately and most likely recommend that the executive committee serve russia with a notice of noncompliance. the consequences for that notice would “very likely” include banning russia from hosting any world championships, as well as banning russian athletes from competing in the 2020 olympic and paralympic games.  russian athletes are still not allowed to participate in international track and field events.  assuming the data is authenticated and any athletes who are suspected of breaching antidoping rules are identified, their cases will be handed over to the international sports federations that govern their sports to pursue sanctions. russia will also have to hand over any physical samples still stored in the moscow laboratory that wada wishes to reanalyze by june 30.

       " 'london — five russian biathletes and five officials with the russian national team are the subject of an investigation into doping and corruption-related offenses, the austrian authorities told the team on a visit to its hotel wednesday.  the case is related to a world cup event in hochfilzen, austria, last year, and comes during a wider criminal investigation into doping and corruption involving the international biathlon union, which is based in salzburg. the organization’s longtime president, anders besseberg, resigned this year shortly after a raid on the union’s headquarters after prosecutors claimed that up to $300,000 had been paid to cover up doping infringements they said were carried out by russian athletes.  the revelation that austrian investigators are investigating the russian athletes and officials comes at a sensitive time as a deadline for the russian authorities to hand over critical laboratory data to the world anti-doping agency draws near. wada says the data is critical to identifying the athletes who participated in a yearslong state-supported cheating scheme unmasked more than two years ago.  doping is a criminal offense in austria. the state attorney’s office for the prosecution of economic offenses and corruption informed the “accused persons” of its investigation at their hotel in hochfilzen, where they were staying for this week’s world cup event. none of the accused have been interviewed, it said.        while the authorities did not provide the names of the individuals involved, a russian news agency said the group included three athletes competing at this week’s world cup and a former olympic gold medalist.  maria zakharova, a russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, described the visit by the authorities to the athlete hotel on the eve of a major competition as “wild.”  the russian news agency tass, citing a russian embassy spokesman in austria, said government officials had been dispatched to hochfilzen “to provide necessary assistance on the spot.”  the case highlights the continuing difficulty russia has had in restoring its battered reputation in international sports. anton shipulin, a gold medalist in biathlon at the tainted sochi games, said he was “angry and furious about the witch hunt that is going on” and, after being named among the suspects, denied that he had ever cheated. another athlete, alexander loginov, said he had been accused of a doping offense related to blood transfusions in 2017.  april’s raid on the biathlon organization that led to the fall of besseberg and his deputy came after the antidoping agency had given details gleaned by its own investigation team to law enforcement officials in norway — where a raid also took place — and austria, as well as to the global police organization interpol.        last month, nine biathletes from kazakhstan — including the country’s entire olympic team — were suspended on suspicion of doping after criminal investigations in austria and italy.  the full scope of the russian doping program was revealed by grigory rodchenkov, a former director of the country’s antidoping laboratory. rodchenkov, who is in hiding in the united states, provided details of abuses in biathlon, according to his lawyer.  doping by russian athletes infected biathlon for years, and even after the wider doping program was unmasked, the i.b.u. faced repeated criticism from many of its own members for what they perceived to be weak antidoping policies and a soft stance toward russia. that prompted teams from the united states, ukraine and the czech republic to withdraw from a season-ending event at the russian resort tyumen this year.  in 2011, jacques rogge, then the i.o.c. president, was so concerned about russia’s biathlon federation that he urged the country’s president at the time, dmitri a. medvedev, to take stronger action. rodchenkov said in a sworn statement that the billionaire owner of the nets, mikhail d. prokhorov, had played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the russian biathlon union. prokhorov, who denies the claim, is helping to finance a new york defamation suit against rodchenkov by three barred biathletes.

       " 'every time ryan crouser flies for work, he braces for questions. don’t worry, he tells security: the five-inch sphere filled with 16 pounds of steel pellets checked into his reinforced luggage is just his shot.  that rarely helps. it seems that like most people, employees of the transportation security administration do not know much about the shot-put, the track and field event crouser has come to dominate.  “you can’t really blame them, but our bags get pulled every flight,” said crouser, who flew to new york for the second time in a month last week to compete in the u.s.a. track &amp; field indoor championships. there, as usual, he competed with his friend and rival joe kovacs.   the two are the reigning olympic gold and silver medalists in the shot-put. for the unfamiliar: that’s the event in which gigantic athletes sheathed in spandex heave palm-size spheres the weight of bowling balls — full of steel, lead or tungsten — as far as they can. crouser got the best of kovacs again at the indoor championships on saturday in staten island, putting his shot 72 feet 10 3/4 inches to kovacs’s 70 feet 2 1/2 inches.         crouser and kovacs’s domination of shot-put is one of the lesser known stories in track and field, a sport that does not have to worry about overexposure. shot-put at the elite level is an often thankless job, with most of the suffering and little of the glory common to other professional sports. the athletes’ work is grueling, and doesn’t make them rich. it barely makes them famous, even in their hometowns in oregon and pennsylvania.  it has, though, made each of them a friend as they travel the world, someone with whom they can bond over their absurd intake of food, their rare moments in the spotlight and the simplicity of their sport.   “you don’t have to worry about the implement or the elements or even a team,” said crouser, who is 6-foot-8 and about 320 pounds. “it almost gets addicting to measure your progress so accurately. all that matters is pure power.”            image     kovacs spun after putting his shot during the qualifying round at the summer olympics in rio de janeiro in 2016.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         crouser and kovacs are embarking on an 18-month globe-trotting journey that will most likely take them to the 2019 world championships in doha, qatar, and the 2020 olympics in tokyo, where they hope to successfully defend their titles — or, in kovacs’s case, swap places with crouser on the podium.         being the best in the united states these days generally means being the best in the world, whether their fellow americans notice or not. they took first and second place at the millrose games this month in manhattan, before repeating at the national indoor championships last weekend in staten island.  so how does one become good at shot-put? start by learning math.   “there’s not much more to throwing a shot than launching a cannon ball,” kovacs, who has a finance degree from penn state, explained in a recent interview. “when the ball comes out, the angle and velocity is just a physics problem. if you can put the velocity behind it, you’re going to have a good throw.”  (shot-putters might be the only athletes in the world who refer to themselves seriously as “human cannons.”)  the athletes keep their eyes wide open as they push the ball forward, and are able to estimate their throw’s distance within a foot. the common “spin” technique uses rotational momentum for power rather than the more traditional and linear “glide” approach. each release produces a bellow.  a good throw begins in the athletes’ legs. but to deliver the ball, they need arms that are strong — and limber. that’s why professional shot-putters spend every week doing gymnastics. the critical move is a “giant,” in which the men leap up and rotate their 300-pound bodies around the high bar, which bends under the strain. those workouts supplement hefty weight sessions in which they bench press more than 500 pounds and squat 700. when he wants a challenge, crouser follows his girlfriend to yoga.  once they’re done, the work isn’t over. that’s when it is time to eat.  both men eat so much food — at least five full meals a day, no fewer than 1,000 calories at each — that it becomes a chore.            image        crouser took the competition at the millrose games this month and at the national indoor championships last weekend.    credit  benjamin norman for the new york times         “i don’t even like food anymore,” crouser said. “each one of my meals is half of what a normal person eats in a day. and i do that five times. if i ever feel hungry during the day that means i’m not doing my job. so i eat all the time. sometimes before another meal i’ll stare at it for a while, like, ‘this again.’”        his girlfriend becomes angry at him for pushing food around on his plate. so he’ll take shortcuts, like eating a large pizza with three meat toppings from domino’s. he chases every meal with 16 ounces of milk. “it’s an easy way to get calories,” he said. “now that i think about it, that’s actually a lot of milk.” (eighty ounces, or more than half a gallon.)   kovacs, who is 5-11 but roughly 300 pounds, starts every day with a carton of scrambled eggs. (“when you’re eating a dozen eggs at once, they’ve got to be scrambled,” he explained.) dinner is no less than a pound of meat, measured after cooking.   looking more like linebackers and lumberjacks than the runners they hang out with can lead to indignities. when shot-putters win, there are no water cooler showers. instead, after his victory at the millrose games, crouser received a bouquet of white flowers that was smaller than one of his arms. and most teammates are not exactly on the 5,000-calorie regimen.   “sometimes when we travel, the meals will be catered to runners: salad and a premade plate with half a chicken breast and a quarter cup of rice,” crouser said. “we tell them, ‘we need like eight of these.’”  so crouser and kovacs will head out together for a second dinner. and then sometimes a third.   weighing more than twice as much as some of their teammates can have its benefits. when traveling, they have to fit on the plane somehow. “my shoulder will hang out the aisle and bang every time the beverage cart comes by,” said crouser, whose shoulders measure a seat and a half wide in coach. “so i find a seat by a distance runner.” forget sitting next to each other — picture preteens in car seats.  there are other adjustments to make outside the track. rare is the men&#x27;s wear brand that outfits a man with a waist-to-thigh ratio of popeye.        “i have to buy huge pants to fit my quads in them, and then use a belt to cinch it all together,” said kovacs, whose waist is 38 and whose thighs are, well, enormous. “i’ve blown out the quads of so many pants.”  it’s not all hard work. crouser discovered one day that he wielded a sledgehammer with a lot of power, too. so he started a video series built around smashing things. that mostly involved a progressive holiday theme featuring  canned pumpkin , a  christmas ornament  and a  snow globe , with an audience engagement strategy of asking viewers to suggest future targets. he called it, “gettin’ smashed with ryan crouser.” (the title is literal; like kovacs, crouser rarely drinks.)            image        kovacs, left, and crouser, right, shared one of their many meals at coogan’s restaurant and bar in washington heights this month.    credit  benjamin norman for the new york times         after the millrose games, in a booth at a restaurant near the track, they ingested the last of the day’s 5,000-calorie allotment and held court for the tiny but passionate cohort that identifies as fans of shot-put. some sent plastic cups of beer that the athletes politely allowed to pile up on the table. others approached for autographs of the meet book’s cover, which featured a picture of kovacs. “wow, your entire autograph fits over your biceps,” one admirer observed.  it had been a good day: organizers showcased their event in the center of the track.   “it’s been cool because these days we go to random places and we throw shot, like on a main street or by a monument, and people seem really into it, they connect,” crouser said. “there are few professional sports events where you can just go hang out with the winners and talk to them after.   “with us, you can.”       ',\n",
       " 'los angeles — ron allice, the track and field coach at the university of southern california, assumed bad news was on the way when donna heinel summoned him to her office back in 2011.  he was right.  heinel, the athletic department administrator who functioned as a gatekeeper over whether recruited athletes could find a spot at the increasingly competitive private university, had found a problem with the track athlete allice was pushing. he had taken a sign language class to fulfill a foreign language requirement and, though that was the standard in the state university systems, heinel dug in against him.  now, allice wonders if there was another reason heinel was so resolute. and he is not alone.  heinel, 57, who as an unyielding, by-the-book administrator rose to a position of unchecked authority during her 16 years in the u.s.c. athletic department, has emerged as a central figure in the academic admissions scandal that has ensnared members of rich — and in some cases famous — families. they are among 50 people charged with carrying out a series of bribes and rigged admissions qualifications, including making up athletic accomplishments, in order to get affluent children into prestigious universities across the country.  nowhere was the scheme more widespread than at u.s.c., where four others who have coached there — one of them until earlier this month — are under indictment. heinel stands accused of being at the fulcrum of the scheme, conspiring with rick singer, a private admissions consultant, to obtain millions in bribes and then easing more than two dozen students into the school through the so-called side door of athletic admissions, using fraudulent athletic profiles.        through a lawyer, heinel, who was fired the day she was indicted, declined to comment.  heinel is the only administrator who has been charged, and her university is the only one of eight involved at which more than one coach has been implicated.  u.s.c.’s interim president, wanda austin, has pledged to revamp its athletic admissions process.  according to the indictment, heinel and singer, the private counselor who hatched the plan, collaborated with the water polo coach, jovan vavic, and the former soccer coach, ali khosroshahin, who was fired in 2013, and his former assistant laura janke, who created phony athletic profiles. like heinel, vavic was fired by u.s.c. on march 12, the day the indictments were unsealed.            image     a college admissions scheme has roiled u.s.c., where several coaches are under indictment.   credit  rozette rago for the new york times         it was a stunning revelation. heinel ran an independent business counseling parents and high school administrators on how to comply with n.c.a.a. regulations. colleagues described her as a stickler for the rules.  tom walsh, the former cross country coach who left u.s.c. in 2013 after 19 years, said coaches sweated the days when they had to attest to the worthiness of their recruits to heinel. “it didn’t matter how good people were,” walsh recalled in an interview last week. “coaches in different sports would commiserate: damn, this is tough.” in fact, walsh said, if you had asked him before the indictment about heinel’s standards, “i’d have said she was as hard as it gets.”        walsh and his former colleagues are now wondering how far back the alleged scam might have gone. heinel required coaches who recruited athletes from europe to have their transcripts translated in the united states to limit the chances of fraud, walsh said. one runner he recruited was an artist. heinel demanded to see a portfolio, and copies or photos of the works were not sufficient. the originals had to be shipped.  “she was basically the gatekeeper,” said a former u.s.c. coach who requested anonymity because he was concerned that being identified could hurt his career. “if you wanted to get someone in, she was the person that really made that decision. or not.”  regardless of that power, heinel largely kept a low profile both on campus and off. she has two children in elementary school and lives with her partner, a school-district special-education administrator, on naples island, an exclusive neighborhood in long beach, calif., known for multimillion-dollar homes on winding canals.  neighbors were shocked when f.b.i. agents surrounded heinel’s house on a narrow, quiet side street just before dawn 10 days ago to arrest her, instructing an inquisitive neighbor to go back in his house. heinel was described by neighbors as quiet and unassuming, driving a red sedan reminiscent of the official color of u.s.c., walking the dog, jogging or riding a bike frequently, and flying drones or playing sports with her son and daughter.  neighbors said heinel generally kept to herself, even when they mentioned their children had gone to u.s.c.            image        court documents allege that rick singer conspired with donna heinel to get unqualified students into u.s.c.   credit  brian snyder/reuters         “it’s usually, ‘hi, how you doing?’” said keith muirhead, a real estate broker who has lived in the house one door down for 36 years. muirhead described heinel as friendly, but said that they had “never socialized, never had a glass of wine, which is unusual because in naples it’s almost a rule.”        it’s not clear when exactly heinel developed a relationship with singer. but since 2014, heinel had presented to admissions more than two dozen students with bogus athletic credentials, including a football player whose high school had no football team, as well as a 5-foot-5 men’s basketball player and a high school cheerleader made to look like a lacrosse star. in fact, emails and recorded phone conversations in the indictment paint a portrait of heinel not merely as a conduit, but also as a fixer who could spot potential brush fires and swept aside skeptical questions.  when counselors at two high schools reviewing applications to u.s.c. last april raised questions with parents about the listed athletic qualifications of their children, heinel called singer. in a voice mail message captured by investigators, she warned that the indignant parents must be stopped from going to the high school “yelling at counselors.”  “that’ll shut everything — that’ll shut everything down,” she said.  around the same time, heinel wrote a lengthy email to the u.s.c. director of admissions to set aside concerns about the athletic credentials of matteo sloane, the son of a drinking and wastewater systems entrepreneur who was admitted as a water polo player despite not playing the sport.  heinel said that because sloane’s high school did not have a water polo team, he played at l.a. water polo club during the school year and traveled internationally with a youth junior team in the summer, playing in greece, serbia and portugal. none of this was true.  “he is small,” heinel continued in the email. “but he has a long torso but short strong legs, plus he is fast which helps him win the draws to start play after goals are scored. he is an attack perimeter player.” she then thanked the admissions director for raising the discrepancy. sloane did not play for u.s.c.  the admissions director replied to heinel, thanking her and saying that a paraphrased version of her email would be passed along to assure the high school officials that u.s.c. had looked into the matter. “they seemed unusually skeptical,” the director wrote.            image        pat haden increased heinel’s power during his tenure as athletic director at u.s.c.   credit  victor decolongon/getty images         there seemed to be no such skepticism of heinel at u.s.c.  through her 16 years at the school, she grew increasingly powerful, controlling two areas that were crucial to coaches: admissions and budgets. that reputation helped lead to her ascent, colleagues said.        pat haden, a former u.s.c. football star lured from his post at a private equity firm to become athletic director after the football and basketball programs were penalized in 2010 for improper benefits to players, tripled the department’s compliance staff. he also promoted heinel to senior woman administrator and the director of admissions and eligibility, jobs that had previously been handled by two associate athletic directors. haden could not be reached for comment.  heinel managed to cash in on her experience navigating admissions for prospective student athletes. in 2008, she established a side business, clear the clearinghouse, which advised high school coaches, counselors and administrators on n.c.a.a. rules for athletes. she offered subscriptions services, for up to $700 annually, and hosted workshops that cost $100, along with offering to do consulting work.  heinel’s business held two-hour workshops at u.s.c.’s galen center. the notices advertising the clinics were sent to about 150 high school and private counselors, either from heinel’s work email account or from that of katie fuller, an assistant director of admissions and eligibility at the school.  typically, about 50 people attended the workshops, according to one private counselor who said she attended two of them, several years apart.  the workshops were unusual in that most schools, including u.s.c., put them on at no cost or for a nominal fee as a sort of public service for counselors.  one of the few documented interviews with heinel is from a panel discussion for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people she participated in at u.s.c. in 2013, at which she described herself “as a loner for mostly all of my life.” growing up in philadelphia, she recalled, she was estranged from her parents for more than two years when she came out to them as gay while she was a student at springfield college in massachusetts, where she was a member of the swim team. but she reconciled with them somewhat a couple of years later when a sister became ill with cancer.            image        heinel conducted workshops in n.c.a.a. compliance at the galen center.   credit  rozette rago for the new york times         the experience of coming out to her parents stayed with her. “i’ve just kind of been, ‘do what i want to do, when i want to do it,” she said.  years later, established in her career as an athletic administrator, heinel quickly developed a rapport with haden, who has a gay son. haden, and his successor, lynn swann, instituted few checks on heinel’s powers.  from october until april, heinel would meet every other thursday with a subcommittee from the admissions office that included the dean of admissions and two assistants. at each meeting, heinel would go through a list of recruits, including their test scores, transcripts and athletic profile, and within a few days would get a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on whether they would be admitted, according to both colleagues and the indictment.  sprinkled among those hundreds of recruits in 19 sports were the fraudulent athletic résumés that heinel is accused of shepherding.  often those profiles were created by janke, who was paid by singer, but according to the affidavit, on at least one occasion, heinel created a profile on a u.s.c. letterhead that made it appear as if the u.s.c. lacrosse coach were lavishing praise on a recruit who in reality had never played the sport.  almost always, within days of one of singer’s clients being conditionally admitted to u.s.c., a check for $50,000 or more made out to “u.s.c. women’s athletics” or “u.s.c. athletics” would arrive in an envelope addressed to heinel. in all, those checks added up to $1.3 million, which were deposited into accounts that heinel largely controlled and could distribute to various teams. (heinel also received $20,000 per month dating to last july from singer in what court documents referred to as a “sham” consulting agreement.)        in explaining to todd blake why he had received a solicitation call asking for another donation to women’s basketball when his daughter was admitted fraudulently as a volleyball player, singer said: “the money went toward her,” referring to heinel, “and she gets to decide where it goes within the department.”  eight years later, allice, the retired track and field coach, remains annoyed. memories of that hurdler were dredged up by the allegations against a woman who now stands accused of fraud. the athlete heinel said did not measure up to the school’s standards was hardly a borderline athlete, much less one of the fakes she and singer created.  the hurdler, johnathan cabral, ended up at u.s.c.’s pac-12 rival, oregon, where he would finish second in the n.c.a.a. finals in the 110-meter hurdles as a senior. a year later he finished sixth during the 2016 olympics while representing canada.

       " 'since sunday, when the canadian women’s hockey league   announced it will cease operations , many have pondered how to elevate women’s professional hockey.  some answers came on tuesday, as the n.h.l. became one of the largest financial backers of the national women’s hockey league — the only remaining pro option for women in the united states and canada — according to both leagues. and the n.w.h.l. announced it would expand into canada.  neither dani rylan, commissioner and founder of the n.w.h.l., nor a spokesperson for the n.h.l. would disclose the length and terms of the deal. the n.h.l. noted that it previously sponsored both women’s leagues, and has now increased its contribution to the n.w.h.l.  a sturdy future partnership between the n.h.l. and n.w.h.l. could dramatically increase exposure for women’s hockey. but former c.w.h.l. players and members of the canadian and u.s. national teams are waiting to see if the n.w.h.l. remains the best option this fall or if another opportunity materializes.        to boost its appeal, the n.w.h.l., which launched in 2015, also announced tuesday its intention to add teams next season in montreal and toronto. those two cities formerly hosted c.w.h.l. franchises. the measure, which was approved by the n.w.h.l. board, would increase the n.w.h.l.’s reach to seven clubs across north america.  rylan said that it is “incredibly important” for the n.w.h.l. to include stars from the c.w.h.l. teams in montreal and toronto — like olympians marie-philip poulin and hilary knight.  “we want to put the best product on the ice,” said rylan, who met with n.h.l. commissioner gary bettman monday. “we knew it was so important to have a presence there so those top players have a place to play this fall.”  knight, a star forward last season on les canadiennes de montréal of the c.w.h.l. (and who left the n.w.h.l. after the 2016-17 season), declined to comment on tuesday’s news, as she prepared to defend a world championship with the u.s. women’s national team in finland this week.  rylan acknowledged logistics like travel to canada must still be figured out. the n.w.h.l. also is looking at increasing its schedule to 24 games, up from 17 this past season.        until those issues and others are sorted out, liz knox, co-chair of the c.w.h.l. players’ association, said her constituents are willing to stay in a holding pattern, even if that means not playing come october.  “it seems like a strategic move for the n.w.h.l.,” knox said. “it seems a little kneejerk to me because our league just folded two days ago. we’re dealing with a very heavy loss. if you lose a family pet you’ve had for 12 years, you don’t go out and buy a new pet two days later.”  knox has been in contact with anya battaglino, director of the n.w.h.l. players’ association, to discuss the best steps for women’s hockey. soon after the u.s. women’s team landed in finland on monday, it held a meeting with players from the canadian national team. since the two countries met in the 2018 olympic final,  both sides  noted the need to work together to advance their sport.  “there will have to be changes in the n.w.h.l. model to make our players happy,” knox said, referring to athletes from both leagues. in  nov. 2016 , the n.w.h.l. drastically slashed salaries.  as of now, the n.h.l.’s involvement won’t resemble the n.b.a.’s backing of the w.n.b.a.: it does not include ice time, or major assistance in marketing, promotion or other business-related aid that would help the n.w.h.l.  the n.w.h.l.’s major sponsor over its first four years of existence was dunkin’ donuts. that deal recently ended, but rylan said the two sides are in the process of renewal and that she expects their partnership to continue.  the n.h.l.’s cachet, of course, could open much bigger doors than the coffee and doughnut chain, including a larger network of international business partners, as well as possible new avenues for broadcasting and streaming options. more revenue from those outlets could also lead to an increase in n.w.h.l. salaries, which last season ranged from $3,000 to $10,000.        battaglino, who said she was extremely proud of the n.w.h.l.’s growth, prioritized better pay as an issue the league should address as it now prepares to extend its reach farther than any women’s pro hockey league before, with a co-sign from the largest hockey influencer in the world.  “women’s hockey players deserve a livable wage,” battaglino said. “women’s hockey players deserve the respect to be able to say, i am a professional athlete, proudly. currently our athletes say, ‘i am a blank and on the nights and weekends i get to play professional hockey.’”       ',\n",
       " 'sarah hirshland took over as chief executive of the united states olympic committee at a fraught time. the organization was reeling from heavy criticism over its response, or its lack of one, to the sexual abuse accusations against lawrence g. nassar, then a team doctor for u.s.a. gymnastics.  now, after six months in the job, hirshland spoke with reporters and editors of the new york times about some of the issues that have dominated the early part of her tenure.  hirshland began the discussion by highlighting four key areas.   hirshland:  the first is, maintaining clear focus on the mission to empower athletes to succeed on the highest level, on the grandest stages, and doing so in an environment that provides them the safety, the resources and the tools they need to be successful in that adventure.  the second is ensuring that athletes have a voice and a seat at the table as the organization is making decisions. they have to play a critical part not only on the field of play but off the field of play.        the third is striving for an environment in the olympic movement that’s free of abuse. there’s some work that’s been done, work that’s being done and work that we need to do.  the fourth is focusing on stewarding the olympic and paralympic movement in this country as we think about our role on the global stage.  excerpts from the interview with hirshland are below:    do you need federal funding at this point? for decades, you got no federal funding. is it time to say we need to get a lot of money from the federal government?   one of the things i hope to do is identify the revenue gap between the size of the pie today and what we think a reasonable size of the pie could and should be to provide the funding to all of the athletes who have the capability to compete at the olympic and paralympic level. there is a revenue gap. if every athlete who had the talent to compete had the tools they needed, what would that number be?  i can’t tell you today what that revenue gap is. then the question becomes, what’s the best way to fill it?          will you push for government funding for the u.s. center for safesport?   every meeting i’ve had in washington, i’ve asked for money for the center for safesport.    how much?   we asked for, it was before my time, i think $5 million a year. what came back was $2.5 million over five years.  i don’t think there’s an easy answer that says, yes, the government’s going to fund this to this amount and here’s where it’s going to come from. we don’t have any confidence that real funding is going to come at this point.    i would think it would be a priority to get it funded properly because it’s sadly underfunded.   the center asked us for $6.2 million next year. we said yes. they haven’t come back and said we need more money.    there are coaches that have been banned who are still coaching. these guys are still out there. sources have said they put in a complaint to safesport and no one got back to them. they probably need a lot more money not only for policing but education.   there is no doubt that the capacity of the center is not where it needs to be to handle the volume. my understanding is that they are growing and hiring as fast as they can. funding is not the issue; it’s capacity and growth rate. it’s a huge priority for us. but at the same time, it’s an independent organization that’s accountable to its board. we have given them every dollar they have asked for. if safesport needs more money, i certainly hope that they will ask for it.    there’s still fallout from all the lawsuits. are you confident the u.s.o.c. will survive? will it have to declare bankruptcy?         i am confident, based on the information i have today, that we will be able to resolve the litigation and be strong and healthy as we go forward.  we take the litigation and our responsibility very seriously. the olympic movement failed these athletes, and we absolutely have a moral and ethical obligation.    how have the sponsorships changed? have you had trouble gaining new sponsorships or lost a lot of sponsorships?   we have not. it’s been a natural process: sometimes a sponsor doesn’t renew and you add a new sponsor, that’s a natural evolution. the numbers and the revenue are not markedly different.    what’s an early look at the los angeles olympics? are people going to be excited about l.a.?   based on really early measures, the answer is absolutely yes. the energy around it is very positive. but this will ebb and flow. we’re still a little bit in the honeymoon of the news that it’s coming.    you’re interfacing with a troubled movement internationally. they’re getting turned down by cities. there has been enormous corruption. it’s a troubled model. how do you fit into that? is there a larger, existential problem?   and yet there are thousands of athletes whose lives are changed for the better constantly by this movement. there’s no doubt there are two sides to the coin. you can’t get too focused on the side you just described that you lose sight of the side i choose to spend more time thinking about.        fundamentally, the olympics and sports in general are about breaking down barriers and uniting people. the complexities of the system continue to expose challenges and the need for change.  we have to set the example, and we have to play better ourselves. we can’t possibly solve all of that if we don’t have our own house in order.    do you think the current olympic model works? every four years having a new city hosting the olympics?   it’s fiscally not responsible to create the infrastructure for an olympic games just for an olympic games. that can’t work. a city has to either need the infrastructure and use the olympics to accelerate its development, or the infrastructure has to exist. the notion that we’re going to go here and build the infrastructure for the olympics is not sustainable.  as we looked at opportunities for the winter games, that’s an incredibly compelling reality of salt lake city. there is not a construction requirement there to host an olympic games.    are there other cities in the pipeline?   we have been very clear in selecting salt lake, to not encourage other cities to prepare to host a winter games. we have determined that salt lake is our best foot forward for the winter. and we are not even contemplating summer beyond l.a.    how confident are you that l.a. will make a profit?   i feel really good about l.a. it’s 10 years out, but the fundamental economic model is really strong because the infrastructure is where the huge part of the cost is. and the infrastructure was either there or was already in the plan to be built as part of l.a.’s natural development.          under your predecessor, the staff of the u.s.o.c. would get bonuses depending on the performance of the athletes at the olympics. is that a good model?   one of the things i’ve changed is the staff incentive model for 2019. there is still a component of athletic success, but it is much more based on a variety of components.    what has the last six months been like?   i logged 115,000 miles in my first five months. i had to make choices about going deep or going broad. i went really broad and met a lot of people at a cursory level. now i’m starting to home in on priorities.  it feels now like a manageable intake, like i have enough space mentally and time to start to take control and implement change.  the only way i can be good and strong for the organization is to keep myself strong mentally and physically. i’m working hard to make sure this doesn’t consume me.  i can’t be fearful on this job. being fearful on this job is not a recipe for success.

       " 'american olympians are considering boycotting a world championship event scheduled to be held in sochi, russia, in february, a move that would represent the most provocative gesture yet by athletes dissatisfied with how sports officials have responded to the continuing russian doping scandal.  american athletes who compete in bobsled and skeleton have circulated memos laying out reasons to avoid participating in the world championships in sochi, the site of the last winter olympics and of elaborate, state-sponsored cheating. the athletes have cited concerns about doping control, personal safety and information security.  the correspondence, some of which was obtained by the new york times, indicates that the athletes have the support of the united states olympic committee. that organization has  not taken a strong public stand  on russia’s systemic doping as it seeks to curry favor with global sports leaders in a bid to hold the 2024 summer games in los angeles.  “this has been passed down the line from the very highest level of sport, and now it’s fallen into the lap of athletes,” said kyle tress, an american skeleton racer. “there’s tremendous support to skip this event, and i think it’s the right decision.”        the united states olympic committee initially declined to comment. on sunday, after this article was published online, a spokesman wrote that the organization supported athletes’ rights to choose when and where to compete. “the u.s.o.c. does not, and will not, support blanket boycotts of any events,” the spokesman added. “any decisions our athletes make will be supported independently from our bid for the 2024 summer games, which is independent and unrelated to these events.”  in recent days, mr. tress and other members of his sport’s athlete advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend that if the competition was not relocated, american athletes should boycott the 2017 world championships. that event is key in determining rankings ahead of the following year’s winter olympics, to be held in pyeongchang, south korea.  in may, a longtime chief of russia’s antidoping laboratory, dr. grigory rodchenkov,  told the new york times  of a cheating operation coordinated by the russian government at the sochi olympics in 2014. top russian athletes doped during the competition, he said, and had their steroid-tainted urine replaced with clean urine for drug testing.  an investigation commissioned by the world anti-doping agency  verified  the account, with its report released in july, and results of another investigation due this week are expected to address which athletes benefited from the cheating.  “the fact that nothing has been done about the sochi scandal and the fact that we’re still going to race there — it doesn’t make us feel secure, or that they’re taking the situation seriously,” said katie uhlaender, an american skeleton racer.        at the sochi games, ms. uhlaender placed fourth, finishing 0.04 of a second behind the bronze medal winner, elena nikitina of russia. ms. nikitina’s urine sample was among those with which dr. rodchenkov said he had tampered, leaving ms. uhlaender  wondering  if she deserved a medal.  this year, numerous olympic medals have been  stripped  from russian athletes for doping offenses at the games in london in 2012 and in beijing in 2008 — but not at sochi.  athletes who are advocating a sochi boycott hope that the world anti-doping agency’s publication of a final investigative report on friday will prompt a stronger response from the international olympic committee and the international bobsleigh and skeleton federation, the sport’s international governing body.  athletes are lobbying for the championships to be moved to a site outside russia and for officials to revisit the standings of the 2014 games as warranted. (the i.o.c. has appointed a disciplinary commission focused on sochi, but it has not taken action ahead of the inquiry report expected this week.)  “perhaps after the report comes out, they’ll listen,” mr. tress said. “there’s politics and money and sponsors involved, but this is an opportunity to come out in favor of clean sport. and they’ve missed that opportunity.”  in july, after wada published an initial report detailing state-sponsored cheating in sochi, the i.o.c. provided guidance to sports organizations planning to host events in russia.  “because of the detailed references to the manipulation of samples during the olympic winter games sochi 2014,” the committee wrote in a  news release , “the i.o.c. asks all international olympic winter sports federations to freeze their preparations for major events in russia, such as world championships, world cups or other major international competitions under their responsibility, and to actively look for alternative organizers.”        nonetheless, plans for february’s championships have moved forward. the i.o.c. has not publicly clarified its guidelines, and the matter is expected to be discussed at the olympic committee’s executive board meetings in switzerland this week.  the international bobsleigh and skeleton federation did not respond to emails requesting comment.  “sochi is in russia, and it’s the place where the cheating happened,” ms. uhlaender said. “i’m confused at how the i.o.c. said what it said, and we’re still holding our world championships there.”  such confusion has transcended nationalities.  “it’s not just the u.s. athletes,” said travis t. tygart, chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency. “athletes around the world are concerned about this, and it’s a last resort,” he added, referring to the consideration of boycotting competitions.  lizzy yarnold of britain, who won a gold medal in skeleton at the sochi games,  said  in october that she was considering skipping the event in sochi in february.  those traveling to russia have concerns extending beyond drug testing, too, after  recent russian cyberattacks  on wada and usada, and the theft of athletes’ private medical information, raised information-security issues.  as groups of athletes organize, they are increasingly forcing national governing bodies to support their cause — an uncomfortable position for united states sports officials, who need the votes of global olympic officials to win the right to host the 2024 games. the race to hold that competition has narrowed to three bidders, with los angeles and paris considered front-runners ahead of budapest.        it was unclear how drug testing at the sochi competition would be handled. wada has decertified russia’s national antidoping agency, making the country ineligible to hold an olympic competition. that ineligibility, some antidoping officials said, should carry over to other international sporting events.  “so long as russia is noncompliant, they should not have events there,” said thorhild widvey, a politician from norway who sits on wada’s executive committee.  craig reedie, wada’s president, who is also a longtime i.o.c. member and has been  criticized  for seeming to run the regulatory agency more as politician than policeman,  expressed eagerness  last month for russia to return to good standing. he invoked the country’s willingness to host major international competitions — something fewer and fewer countries are vying for.  mr. tress said, “there hasn’t been a sufficient response from people in leadership positions, and there’s a lot of frustration.”       ',\n",
       " 'for years now, nearly a decade, ed cheserek’s path seemed obvious.  a gifted teenage runner from kenya, he had become a high school sensation at st. benedict’s prep in newark, and then a star at the university of oregon. a distance specialist, cheserek could win races as long as 10,000 meters, or drop down and a run a sub-four-minute mile as needed. cheserek won 17 national championships at oregon, and when he graduated in 2017, he was the most decorated runner in n.c.a.a. history.  his next move seemed clear. he would become an american citizen and represent the country in the biggest distance races and the biggest competitions the way other runners born in africa — bernard lagat, meb keflezighi, abdi abdirahman — had done before him.  it has not gone that way, not yet anyway. instead, cheserek, now 25 and back in new york this week to run in the wanamaker mile at the millrose games, is caught between two countries, trapped in a dispute involving immigration law, specialized work visas and the strange question of just how elite a runner he can claim to be.   all this is unfolding as cheserek evolves, trying to become the runner he has always wanted to be. like plenty of other 20-somethings, he is learning that the path to what he wants is rarely as straight, or as simple, as it once seemed.        he has moved to flagstaff, ariz., where he trains at elevation alongside some of the best distance runners in the world. it feels like home, he said, but his application for a green card has been rejected. even receiving a temporary work visa, something that seemed as if it would be simple given his elite skills, has proved difficult. his lawyer uses stronger words to describe the process: “arbitrary and capricious,” though he said the difficulties went back to the years of the obama presidency.  “all i can do is just keep running until they decide what they decide,” cheserek said in a telephone interview this week.  mostly, he has been very good at that. cheserek ran the second-fastest indoor mile ever last year, finishing in 3 minutes 49.44 seconds at the david hemery valentine invitational in boston, but he is certain his greatest successes will come in the 5,000 and the 10,000.   just 5-foot-6 but with the chiseled physique of an undersize n.f.l. cornerback, cheserek has a stride that, regardless of how fast he is running, makes him appear to float across any distance. other than the slightest roll of his shoulders, he is a model of what looks like effortless efficiency. then in an instant, he produces his trademark burst of speed that, throughout college at least, almost always left his competition far behind.        “he’s a kind of freakish combination of strength and speed,” said stephen haas, who has been coaching cheserek for the past year.            image     oregon’s edward cheserek reacted as he runs toward the finish line to win the men’s n.c.a.a. division i cross-country championships in 2013 in terre haute, ind.   credit  darron cummings/associated press         it is also what sets him apart. consider keflezighi, for example, the winner of the new york city and boston marathons and a versatile athlete who like cheserek won national championships in cross-country and at 5,000 and 10,000 meters in college. keflezighi has never broken four minutes for the mile. mo farah, widely considered the world’s most versatile distance runner, has never run a mile faster than 3:56.  cheserek, though, has plenty of ground to make up in the longer distances before he can be considered world class in those events, where even his best times are 43 seconds off the world record in the 5,000 and more than two minutes behind the mark in the 10,000.  to be fair, cheserek has yet to have a complete and healthy outdoor season as a professional. haas said he was certain an injury-free cycle of training that now included 100-mile-plus weeks and faster, longer runs as cheserek headed into the spring and summer was going to produce significant breakthroughs at the distances cheserek believes are his specialty.  a glimpse of the future may have occurred at the manchester road race in connecticut on a frigid thanksgiving morning last fall, when the runner known as king cheserek at oregon set a course record. he ran the 4.75-mile course in 21:16, beating paul chelimo, the 5,000-meter silver medalist at the 2016 rio olympics, and andy butchart, a british olympian, by 30 seconds.  so does he now prefer the roads to the track? “roads, track, i don’t care,” cheserek said. “running is running.”  exactly what country he will represent is a much more complex question. thomas young, a colorado immigration lawyer who has represented many athletes and now oversees cheserek’s citizenship case, said the process had become much less predictable since 2015, before president trump was elected.        cheserek has said since high school that his dream is to become an american citizen and to represent the united states in the olympics. it should be noted that american distance running teams are usually easier to make than kenyan ones, though cheserek’s indoor mile time last year set a kenyan record.  cheserek’s current challenge is that he attended oregon on a student visa and was not able to obtain a green card while he was there, young said. after oregon, he applied for a green card, seeking approval on the basis of his athletic accomplishments, but was told he had not proved himself against pro runners.   “if 17 n.c.a.a. championships won’t get you a green card, nothing will,” young said.  until cheserek has a green card, the clock cannot start ticking on the five years he has to wait before he can apply for united states citizenship. an act of congress could expedite that process, but not much else. so if cheserek, approaching his prime, wants to appear at this year’s world championships or next year’s olympics in tokyo, he will have to do it running for kenya. (a later switch of nationality is allowed under international track and field rules.)  in the meantime, young has helped cheserek obtain a p1 visa, more commonly referred to as the athlete and artist visa. it allows people who can demonstrate extraordinary talent to live and work in the united states for up to five years because their professions require the participation of the best people in the world. (think of foreign-born n.b.a. stars and virtuoso violinists.)  in january 2018, the united states citizenship and immigration services, which does not comment on individual cases, granted cheserek a p1 visa for only one year rather than five.            image        cheserek has become one of the best-known runners in the united states.   credit  veasey conway for the new york times         an application to extend his visa is still under review. immigration officials have questioned whether the track meets and races cheserek was participating in really required athletes of “international recognition,” as the statute states.         young said the concerns about cheserek’s schedule were unfounded because the events he wanted to run — which included the new balance indoor grand prix, the millrose games and the prefontaine classic — were among the most prestigious meets in the world, so of course they required the services of internationally recognized athletes.  cheserek has until april 15 to file additional information. he is allowed to continue living and training in the united states until the case is decided, which may take several months.  until then, all he can do is run. the best result he can hope for is the path of lagat, who attended washington state. lagat began his career running for kenya but then represented the united states after gaining citizenship.  “these athletes have a very short window of time to compete at the highest level internationally,” said chris lane, cheserek’s agent. “we don’t want to restrict ed from accomplishing his goals, and those include medals in the worlds and the olympics.”       ',\n",
       " 'when christine girard was presented with the gold medal in weight lifting from the 2012 olympics, there was a podium, a canadian flag and an anthem sung by a choir. in the audience were olympians, officials, friends and family.  included among them were her three children, none of them yet born in 2012. that’s because the presentation of the medal came on monday, more than six years after the competition.  in london, girard lifted a total of 520 pounds, good for third place in her division. it was the first medal ever for a female canadian weight lifter. but in 2016, maiya maneza of kazakhstan and svetlana tsarukayeva of russia were disqualified after retesting of their samples revealed performance-enhancing drugs. girard became the retroactive gold medalist.  at the national arts center in ottawa, about 100 people gathered for a 20-minute ceremony during which girard finally got her gold medal.        “it was a win of our values, a win for clean sport,” girard said.  the increasing number of medal-winning athletes caught by testing years later, especially from the 2008 and 2012 games, has meant more and more athletes are receiving medals that for years they thought they had lost.            image     girard competing in the weight lifting event held at the 2008 olympics.   credit  ezra shaw/getty images         not all of them had elaborate ceremonies. adam nelson, the american shot-putter elevated to gold for the 2004 games, was  handed his medal o utside a burger king at the atlanta airport in 2013.  “anything they could do to recognize the athletes that were robbed of the moment would certainly go a long way toward repairing some of the damage that was done,” nelson  told usa today .  girard said: “i think it’s really important to have a big ceremony. the more we talk about the positive, the better it could be for future athletes.”        even when girard was competing, the specter of drugs hung over the competition. “unfortunately, my sport has a strong correlation between the results and taking drugs,” she said. of her competitors at the time, she said, “we had a lot of suspicion, but we had no proof.”  girard returned her 2012 bronze medal last spring. but the gold she was awarded on monday was not the one that maneza was given. “they made new medals or they took some from the museum,” girard said.  girard also received a bronze from the 2008 games in beijing, where she originally finished fourth.  besides her motherhood duties, the now-retired girard is planning to return to college for a master’s in occupational therapy.  she is bullish on the future for clean weight lifters.  “i wanted to prove that it was possible to beat them,” she said of drug users, “and stay true to who we are. i remember the first time i beat someone who got caught. i said, ‘see, see, i can do this.’”       ',\n",
       " 'the vote last week by the world anti-doping agency  to allow russia to return  to the international sports fold has laid bare the deep fissures within the community of athletes and officials who oversee the world’s competitions.  in the days since the decision to take russia off the top antidoping organization’s list of noncompliant countries, dozens of current and former athletes and leaders of national antidoping agencies, largely from western nations, have voiced their frustration with wada for what they see as letting russia off the hook after it corrupted years of international events, including the 2014 winter olympics.  in what amounted to a series of emergency meetings, travis tygart, chief executive of the united states anti-doping agency, spent wednesday in washington with a contingent of other antidoping supporters, including linda hofstad helleland, the vice president of wada who voted against clearing the russians, and emma coburn, an olympic bronze medalist in track and field. they rushed from appointment to appointment, talking to lawmakers and government officials about the need for wada reform.  they spent the morning at the white house in discussions with jim carroll, deputy director of the office of national drug control policy, and then headed to capitol hill for sit-downs with representatives and senators.        helleland, a norwegian politician who was one of the two dissenters in the 9-2 vote for russia’s reinstatement, was in new york for meetings at the united nations, and said she added a day in washington onto her business trip because this was a critical time in the history of antidoping.  “antidoping hasn’t been on the agenda of political leaders, but now they are paying attention because the russia situation has been a big wake-up call,” said helleland, who plans to run for wada president next year. “i’ve never seen anything like what’s happening in sports right now. athletes everywhere are telling me that they’ve lost their belief in antidoping. it’s so painful for me to hear, and we’ve got to do something about it right now.”  with the united states set to host the olympics in 2028, tygart said there was a new opportunity for the federal government to focus on worldwide antidoping.  “our government is going to invest a lot of time and money into the games here, and it should want those games to be clean,” tygart said, adding that worldwide governments’ sudden interest in antidoping “is a silver lining in this very dark cloud.”        coburn, an american runner who was the 2017 world champion in steeplechase, said athletes understand they need to come together to do the work that wada was supposed to do to ensure fair play.            image     beckie scott resigned from her post on wada’s compliance review committee after it became clear that the agency would vote for russian reinstatement.   credit  jeff mcintosh/the canadian press, via associated press         “wada failed its athletes by promoting cheating and rewarding countries that are cheating and stealing our medals, our money and our memories,” she said. “with the russia drama, we’re seeing more and more athletes speak out.”  at issue is whether wada should have removed russia from the list of noncompliant countries before russia met two requirements for reinstatement: admit to state-sponsored doping that involved the highest state authorities and turn over all the computer data and thousands of possibly tainted biological samples collected from athletes.  jonathan taylor, chairman of wada’s compliance review committee, said he understood the frustration of those who felt russia didn’t show enough contrition and “say there should’ve been a greater mea culpa.”  “but we do have explicit acknowledgment from the russians,” he added.  in voting to take russia off its noncompliant list without requiring the country to admit state-sponsored doping, wada received a commitment from russia to turn over the computer data and the samples by december 31, an assurance that wada officials say they did not previously have.  when it became clear how wada would vote, beckie scott, an olympic champion cross-country skiier from canada, resigned in protest from her post on wada’s compliance review committee. at the 2002 salt lake city olympics, scott finished third in the five-kilometer pursuit but was later awarded gold after two russians were stripped of their medals for doping. after the vote, victoria aggar, a paralympic rower on the athlete committee, called it “the most devastating day in the history of antidoping.”  what has become clear since the vote is that tension between athletes and sports officials — especially those connected to the international olympic committee, which has pushed for russia’s reinstatement — has been growing for some time.        at a meeting ahead of the wada vote last week in the seychelles, scott attempted to make a spirited defense of her position that russia had not done enough to be cleared and was roundly criticized.  “athletes should know their place,” said one official, according to people present at the meeting.   edwin moses , the chairman of wada’s education committee and the united states anti-doping agency, said officials attacked scott verbally when she challenged them. he added that a wada member had described scott, a fierce anti-doping advocate, as “emotional.”  “i think it was very sexist,” moses said. “a lot of women came up to me afterward. it’s not right, it’s beyond the dignity of the committee and it’s been going on awhile.”  moses, who won two olympic gold medals and 122 consecutive 400-meter hurdles races in the 1970s and 1980s, did not fare much better. at a meeting in may, patrick baumann, a swiss official who leads basketball’s international governing body and sits on a number of i.o.c. panels, told moses he was not entitled to speak during a discussion about russia’s fate.  taylor, the british lawyer leading the wada committee that is looking into russian compliance, initially said russia needed to do more be taken off the noncompliant list, specifically by making a commitment to provide access to data required to analyze 10,000 suspicious samples.            image        edwin moses, the two-time olympic champion and chairman of the u.s. anti-doping agency, has said he was originally encouraged to be an independent thinker within the olympic movement. “that’s not the case anymore,” he said.   credit  valery hache/agence france-presse — getty images         documents have shown that russia was unwilling to make the commitment ahead of last week’s meeting, then reversed course at the last minute, leading taylor’s committee to change its recommendation. that led to furious complaints from athlete groups largely from north america and western europe.        wada’s executive committee is split between government representatives and i.o.c.-appointed sports officials, with the two groups each responsible for 50 percent of the agency’s budget. the only athlete representative with a decision-making role on the executive committee was danka bartekova, a member of the i.o.c.’s own athlete commission.  wada’s president, craig reedie, is also an i.o.c member.  “i’ve tried consistently to be an independent and neutral chairman,” reedie said. “and i have been bruised on a number of occasions, not the least by the i.o.c.”  seven members of the wada athlete commission led by scott signed a letter ahead of the crucial meeting that said, “it should not be possible to commit the biggest doping scandal of the 21st century, then be reinstated without completing the conditions set.”  among those not to sign the letter was kirsty coventry, a former swimmer, who is also the chairwoman of the i.o.c.’s athletes commission. her group released its own statement, which supported russia’s return.  “i believe our mandate is to protect all clean athletes, and i believe there are clean russian athletes,” coventry’s statement said.  mark adams, chief spokesman for the i.o.c., said in a statement that the athletes on its commission, who are elected by their peers, were “the ones that best represent the views of athletes globally.” the members of the wada athlete commission are appointed.  moses said when he was first nominated to the i.o.c.’s athletes’ commission decades ago, he was told the organization wanted him to be an independent thinker. “that’s not the case anymore,” he said.        russia has gone to the court of arbitration for sport to lift its ban from international track and field events, a separate punishment from wada’s penalties.  david howman, who was wada’s chief executive from 2003 to 2016, said the organization had changed from “being an organization that cared about clean athletes to one that cares about international federations that have not been able to stage events in russia.”  “it’s money over principle,” he added. “that is a quite a difference, quite a swing, from what wada once was.”       ',\n",
       " 'on thursday, the world anti-doping agency’s executive committee will gather in the seychelles to hold the most crucial antidoping meeting in recent times.  until friday, the russian anti-doping agency was deemed still not fit for reinstatement into the global antidoping community — a result of the egregious state-supported doping system exposed through the pound and mclaren investigations in 2015 and 2016. however, just days before the wada executive committee is to decide whether to bring russia back, wada has made a sudden about-face by releasing a recommendation that its executive committee vote for its return.  this has sparked shock among sports fans and clean athletes worldwide, who, like me, and with no transparency from the global antidoping body, are scratching their heads at this abrupt, curiously timed development. is this the same russia that has, until now, been vehemently opposed to the facts and evidence in the mclaren report?  as is widely known, rusada has still not met the two conditions required for reinstatement: as wada has consistently told us, the russian authorities had failed to publicly accept the outcomes of the mclaren report, which revealed broad, state-sponsored doping, and they had also failed to grant wada access to stored urine samples still held in a moscow laboratory.        now, despite wada’s change of heart, athletes and the public have still not seen public acknowledgment from russia of its state-sponsored doping program (as required by wada’s russian road map), and there has still not been a visit by wada officials to the laboratory to access urine samples. with those facts, what sort of confidence will wada’s volte-face instill?  wada’s decision is questionably timed, coming just as international athletes on friday began one of the strongest antidoping campaigns ever, imploring wada to make the right decision not to readmit russia. the decision will anger sports fans and clean athletes, whose trust in the global antidoping authority is already wafer thin. they want a  strong  wada that backs clean sport, and doesn’t look to appease a handful of sports politicians.  in recent weeks, sports officials, who represent half of wada, had been trying to persuade members of the executive committee to vote for the reinstatement of rusada. as a former athlete, and as someone who regularly speaks to athletes everywhere, i can tell you that they are shocked that this could happen.  let’s remind ourselves that just over two years ago, the results of the mclaren investigation revealed incontestable evidence that russia had perpetrated the most grotesque abuse of power and masterminded the biggest doping scandal in the history of sporting competition. yet the international olympic committee — ignoring wada’s recommendation — gave russia something of a pass and allowed some russian athletes to compete at the rio 2016 olympic games.  the world — including the overwhelming majority of athletes — looked on in astonishment as wada’s lack of power was so publicly exposed and the i.o.c. showed themselves to be so staggeringly out of touch. ever since that regrettable period, the priority of sporting figures at the i.o.c. and on wada’s executive committee has seemingly been to bring russia back.        take the i.o.c.’s “fudge” in february at the pyeongchang olympics where they “barred” russian athletes, only to open the door for 168 of the country’s athletes to compete in a uniform with the words ‘olympic athlete from russia’ emblazoned on the front. as if this wasn’t enough to perplex athletes and sports fans around the world, the i.o.c. then had the audacity to reinstate the russian olympic committee just days after the closing ceremony.  these decisions have left the antidoping system on life support. yet it still seems lessons have not been learned by the decision makers — the individuals responsible for representing clean competition and upholding trust in sport, not undermining it.  in the aftermath of the mclaren investigation, governments and antidoping organizations have made constructive efforts to reform the system, strengthen wada and give the agency the tools it needs, such as greater sanctioning powers. that, let’s remind ourselves, would have taken the decision of russian athletes’ participation at rio 2016 out of the hands of the i.o.c. and put it into wada’s.  the sports representation on the agency’s executive committee has often tried to stop wada from getting the sanctioning powers it needs. while the global athlete community expects us to come together and  strengthen  wada, the powers-that-be from the sporting movement continually attempt to  undermine  its power. this is, candidly, a dereliction of duty.  with wada’s sudden shift in position raising questions about its transparency and about where its loyalties lie, we must begin the journey of returning trust to the system, enhancing wada and creating a system fit for the next generations of athletes.  having spoken to athletes, i know they overwhelmingly support the  right  decision being made in the seychelles — they overwhelmingly support wada’s sticking to its road map. this was not the time, they say, for the global antidoping body to perform the u-turn of all u-turns.  has wada now performed the fudge of all fudges to appease the i.o.c., and to simply move on from “the russia issue”? given the facts, it would seem so. we must demand that the global antidoping authority make public its recommendation, and the reasons for it.  the antidoping movement owes it to athletes to return trust to the system by making open, fair decisions, because without their trust, where are we with the clean-sport effort?

       " 'the united states anti-doping agency is seeking to reassure american athletes that their private medical information is safe after russian hackers gained access to the email account of one of the agency’s officials.  the same cyberespionage group that stole private medical information from the world anti-doping agency’s athlete database last summer more recently compromised the email account belonging to the science director of the american agency. the agency believes the breach occurred in early september in rio de janeiro, at the start of the paralympic games.  the federal authorities have assessed the extent of the damage and are investigating the attack, the united states agency said.  travis tygart, chief executive of usada, called the attacks “deplorable” on friday, adding: “our athletes here in the u.s. get it, and they see these cyberattacks for exactly what they are: a blatant attempt to baselessly smear the reputations of clean athletes and to distract from the state-supported doping system that corrupted the sochi games.”        the hackers, calling themselves fancy bear — a group believed to be associated with the g.r.u., the russian military intelligence agency suspected of involvement in the recent  cyberattack  on the democratic national committee — published files this month relating to american athletes whom the sports authorities had granted waivers to take prohibited drugs.  such waivers, known as therapeutic use exemptions, have been central to the recent fancy bear hacks. when the group  began publishing athlete files in mid-september , it argued that the exemptions — granted by top sports authorities and approved by wada and the international olympic committee — constituted sanctioned doping and delivered an unfair advantage.  russia’s president, vladimir v. putin,  expressed  that view this week, suggesting that athletes with drug exemptions should compete in special, segregated categories. the russian government has denied ties to the fancy bear attack.  more than 25 american athletes — including high-profile olympians like simone biles and serena and venus williams — were affected by the hackers’ first several rounds of disclosures, staggered over several weeks.        ms. biles, 19, subsequently said that she had received a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder years earlier, adding that she was not ashamed of her disorder or by the disclosure of her sensitive medical information.          also affected were more than 100 athletes from 26 other countries — including one from russia — who had permission to take a range of medications to treat conditions like allergies, asthma and attention disorders.  but with the latest batch of files, published oct. 7 and drawing on the american antidoping agency’s emails, the hackers focused squarely on the united states, citing “more than 200 american athletes who have permission to take banned drugs” whose names and waivers they had gained access to via a spreadsheet stored on email.  (the united states files,  first reported on by forbes , were taken down for roughly five days, during which the fancy bear site was down.)  the email breach affected one individual’s account, the united states antidoping agency said this week; that account belonged to matthew fedoruk, the organization’s science director.  dr. fedoruk was working at the oceanside hotel where the international paralympic committee was headquartered, in the barra da tijuca neighborhood of rio. his account was thought to have been compromised through the wi-fi network he was using there.  the organization was not aware of the breach until fancy bear announced it roughly a month later.  the american agency said this week that its email servers had not been compromised and that the breach had affected mr. fedoruk’s account alone. the agency said it had determined that fancy bear made failed attempts through different channels to gain access to other files, including the agency’s financial records.        russia was barred from participating in the paralympics after revelations of government-sponsored doping and coordinated cover-ups that relied on help from russia’s federal security service.  in recent days, mr. tygart sent a video message to all american athletes whose information had been made public. he said he had spoken with dozens of athletes and their parents by phone.  mr. tygart called on global sports leaders to condemn the hacks. thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee, has called the breaches “unacceptable” while suggesting that responsibility lies with wada, which ought to “significantly improve its information security standards to comply with the international data privacy regulations and to prevent data leakage of critical information.”  the fancy bear hackers have threatened to continue to release information, suggesting last friday that dr. fedoruk’s emails were only the start of the correspondence they had obtained.  as investigations into elaborate government-ordered cheating by russia at the last winter olympics continue, “some leaders in olympic sport have taken the bait and are talking more about this,” mr. tygart said of the hacks, “than about imposing meaningful consequences on a state-run doping program and how to ensure that it never happens again.”       ',\n",
       " 'u.s.a. basketball plans to gauge the interest of the duke university sensation zion williamson in joining the americans’ 12-man squad for the fiba world cup in china this summer, according to a person familiar with u.s.a. basketball’s intentions.  no discussions have taken place with williamson, whose freshman season at duke ended sunday with a  68-67 quarterfinal loss against michigan state  in the n.c.a.a. tournament.  formal talks with williams, the presumptive no. 1 overall n.b.a. draft pick, would most likely not take place until williams had officially declared his intention to turn professional and chosen an agent licensed by the n.b.a. to represent him, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly.  but the precedent for such an invitation was set by the current u.s.a. basketball hierarchy in 2012, when anthony davis — fresh off being drafted no. 1 overall out of kentucky by the new orleans pelicans — earned a roster spot with team usa at the london olympics under duke coach mike krzyzewski.        the 2019 world cup, which runs aug. 31 to sept. 15 in china, will be the first major competition for the united states since krzyzewski was succeeded as coach by gregg popovich of the san antonio spurs. williamson is widely regarded as the rare sort of talent, like davis before him, who would not be out of place with the n.b.a. all-stars expected to fill out popovich’s roster — no matter who is coaching.  the athletic reported monday that the lakers’ lebron james, a three-time olympian, would not make himself available for the world cup team this summer but that he had not ruled out playing for team usa at the tokyo olympics in 2020.  there was some hope in international basketball circles that james would consider playing in the world cup since the lakers had missed the playoffs and james would sit out the n.b.a. postseason for the first time since 2004-05.  jerry colangelo, the chairman of u.s.a. basketball, declined to discuss james or williamson specifically when he was reached on monday, saying only that roster invitations “will be addressed at the appropriate time.”       ',\n",
       " 'the n.b.a. coaches steve kerr and nate mcmillan and the college coach jay wright have been chosen as u.s.a. basketball assistant coaches under the national team’s new head coach, gregg popovich, according to two people familiar with u.s.a.b.’s selections.  golden state’s kerr, indiana’s mcmillan and villanova’s wright will bring significant experience — and a measure of star power — to popovich’s bench in their roles as assistants for the 2019 fiba world cup in china as well as the 2020 olympics in tokyo, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the appointments publicly.  the united states hasn’t formally qualified for the 2019 world cup but is in a strong position. led by its qualifying coach, jeff van gundy, and featuring a rotating roster of players primarily from the n.b.a.’s g league, team u.s.a. is 7-1 with just four qualifiers remaining. one or two more wins should clinch a spot in china.  popovich, entering his 22nd full season as coach of the san antonio spurs, is succeeding duke coach mike krzyzewski as head coach of the men’s senior national team after krzyzewski’s wildly successful run from 2006-16, with a record of 88-1. team u.s.a. won five major championships under krzyzewski: olympic gold in 2008, 2012 and 2016 and fiba world cup titles in 2010 and 2014.        kerr, 53, has been close to popovich since he played for him in san antonio. kerr has won three championships in his first four seasons as head coach of the warriors.  mcmillan, 54, was a u.s.a.b. assistant under krzyzewski from 2006 to 2012 and led the pacers to a 48-34 record last season that made indiana the surprise of the eastern conference.  wright, 56, has coached villanova to two national championships in the past three seasons, establishing himself as the hottest coach in the college game.

       " 'as soccer mavens everywhere struggle to process the prospect of a world cup that will kick off next summer without the united states, the netherlands or even four-time champion italy, something even more incomprehensible is happening in the arena of international basketball.  thursday marks the start of qualifying play for the 2019 fiba world cup, with 80 countries from four geographical zones vying for 31 open slots in the tournament alongside the tournament’s host, china.  one kristaps porzingis-sized caveat: players from the n.b.a., and an overwhelming majority from the euroleague — merely the two best basketball leagues on earth — won’t be participating.  you read correctly. fiba has decided to co-opt a similar qualifying model to the one its fifa counterparts employ to establish the field for soccer’s world cup — except that basketball’s international governing body has no authority to compel n.b.a. or euroleague teams to release players to join their national teams for the requisite “windows,” as they’re known, scheduled for this month and again in february.        “when i first heard about it, i had to have it explained to me about five times to wrap my head around what they were trying to do,” said andrew bogut of the los angeles lakers, one of the mainstays of australia’s national team  in soccer, of course, top leagues habitually take multiple in-season “international breaks” that, with fifa’s backing, enable national teams to summon any healthy player they want for qualifying matches.  in international basketball, by contrast, no such culture exists. fiba’s move away from a longstanding reliance on summer qualifying tournaments for its own major competitions, which more often than not ensured the availability of n.b.a. players, will now lead to numerous national teams asking players of lesser stature to get them to china. the expectation is that many of those players would then be asked to step aside so more decorated players can participate in the actual championship.  for the united states, that means assembling a roster featuring 11 players from the n.b.a.’s developmental league, and one current free agent, to take on puerto rico in orlando on thursday and mexico on sunday in greensboro, n.c. the espn analyst and former new york knicks coach jeff van gundy will provide the lone semblance of star power from the u.s. bench.  “think about the team van gundy is putting together,” said the san antonio spurs assistant coach ettore messina, who was forced to relinquish his role as head coach of the italian national team because of the new format.        “they will qualify, because they will be very well prepared and play hard. but then you have to tell them: ‘thank you. now the real players are coming in to go to china.’ how unfair is that?”  messina has been perhaps the loudest critic of the changes in a sport that, since the entree of n.b.a. players into olympic play in 1992, has largely operated under the premise that the summer is national team time.  in september, at a news conference during the eurobasket tournament, messina branded the idea of players and coaches helping their nations qualify and then being replaced for the world cup as “a humiliation.”  three months later, messina is in no mood to soften his position.  “stupid,” messina said. “that’s the most common word i hear when i talk with people about this — stupid.”            image     jameel warney, shown playing against the virgin islands in september, is one of the players who is likely to compete for team usa in fiba world cup qualifying.   credit  eitan abramovich/agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         fiba’s stated reasoning for the format overhaul, in truth, isn’t blindly boneheaded. the idea was that a return to the soccer-style system used in the pre-n.b.a. days would give every country competing a chance to play meaningful matches at home, as opposed to traveling to one central tournament. the change, fiba hoped, would provide more fans in many more locales increased opportunities to see not only their best countrymen but stars from rival nations.  the san antonio guard manu ginobili, for example, told me in a recent interview that he could scarcely recall his native argentina playing a single “real” game at home — beyond exhibitions — throughout a glorious national team career than spanned nearly two decades.        “having games at home in every country i think is potentially very good,” ginobili said. “but then if you’re not able to play with your best players ...”  the sentence did not need finishing. imagine what world cup qualifying would look like in soccer if, say, neither england’s premier league nor spain’s la liga had to release its players to participate.  ginobili and his teammate with the spurs, pau gasol, who plays for spain, both admit that they struggle to imagine the day that the n.b.a. would ever consent to the concept of international breaks during the season so that players could leave the teams paying them.  “probably not in my lifetime,” gasol said with a smile.  trying to summarize the ongoing battle between fiba and euroleague officials about making more than a few fringe euroleaguers available to participate in upcoming qualifiers, in our allotted space, would be another serious struggle. but even if those entities eventually do find a level of greater compromise than we’re seeing at the moment, there’s no denying that a gaping void will linger in the qualifying process without n.b.a. involvement.  when the 2017-18 n.b.a. season commenced, 113 international players from 42 countries and territories occupied roster spots in a league with only 510 available. but playing out their n.b.a. dreams means they can’t help their countries now even if they want to, whether we’re talking puerto rico’s ever-gritty j.j. barea, greece’s incomparable giannis antetokounmpo or the latvian unicorn porzingis from the knicks.  for the veteran guard jose calderon of the cleveland cavaliers — who quickly points out that none of the 12 players on his spanish squad that won a bronze medal at the 2016 rio olympics and again at eurobasket 2017 just a few months ago are on the qualifying roster — fiba’s mistake was forging ahead with the format switch without polling more of the participants.  “i understand what fiba is trying to do,” calderon said. “but at the end of the day, i think everything is impossible if you don’t talk to the players. those are the first ones you have to involve.        “right now i feel like the players are in the middle. maybe it’s time to sit everybody together and start talking about how to do it and do it the right way.”  none of this talk, mind you, is intended to slight the players and coaches who will step unto the breach starting thursday.  puerto rico’s determination to play on in the wake of hurricane maria’s devastation , for starters, is undeniably inspiring.  and van gundy, predictably, has embraced the challenge of trying to craft a cohesive unit from his cast of little-known n.b.a. aspirants with great pride. the americans will have enjoyed a mere six days’ worth of practices before taking on the displaced puerto ricans at the university of central florida in orlando on thanksgiving day. the americans will operate as the road team.  since coaching a similar squad to the americup title in argentina in early september, van gundy has spoken often of the “great stories” that the likes of larry drew ii, reggie hearn and americup mvp jameel warney bring to the job in their quest to break through to the big time. he insists his unheralded group sees the task to “get our team qualified” as an honor, which would then allow messina’s san antonio boss, gregg popovich, and the team of n.b.a. all-stars that popovich will assemble as mike krzyzewski’s successor with team usa, to go “do their thing” in china.  “imagine spain, france, canada — they’ve all got a lot of players that also won’t be able to play,” ginobili said of qualifying.  “i think the idea can be good, but only if you can execute it in the right way. you need consensus.”       ',\n",
       " 'three-on-three basketball, which is coming to the olympics in 2020, would seem to be a sport the united states could do well in. a team of, say, lebron james, stephen curry and anthony davis would be unstoppable.  but should you take a look at the field for the three-on-three world cup next month in the philippines, you will see something curious. kyrgyzstan is in the men’s lineup, as are estonia, jordan and mongolia. but the united states is not.  the reason is an unusual qualifying system designed to grow the sport all year long as much as find the best teams for the world cup. that could also keep the united states, the birthplace of basketball and home to the world’s best players, out of the olympics as well.  fiba, the international basketball organization, has high hopes for three-on-three basketball, and wants to increase the format’s profile quickly.        “it will bring another audience to the sport of basketball,” said julian debove, a senior communications manager at fiba. he meant younger viewers, but, just as important, fiba sees three-on-three as a boon for smaller countries. “it’s a new opportunity for member organizations to participate and win medals,” debove said. “to be successful in basketball, you need eight to 12 guys who can perform. in three-on-three, if you have four players with high-level talent you can win medals.”  medal winners in the first four world cups include qatar and the netherlands on the men’s side and belgium, hungary and czech republic for women, none of which are traditional basketball powers.  the field for the world cup is based entirely on ranking: there was no qualifying tournament. and at the cutoff date last year, the united states men ranked 12th, behind latvia and estonia. the women were 13th behind venezuela, hungary and even andorra.  one reason is that mere participation in three-on-three events can earn points. “andorra has heavy participation every weekend,” debove said.        since many of the top-ranking events are in europe, the opportunity for americans to participate is smaller.            image     france and slovenia faced off in a semifinal match in the 2017 fiba 3x3 world cup.   credit  loic venance/agence france-presse — getty images         individual rankings are also factored in. so a james-curry-davis dream team would have no ranking points at all unless the stars took the unlikely route of hitting the european three-on-three circuit.  fiba has created this system because it wants to promote its three-on-three tour, not just the olympics and the world cup. it also wants to establish players who are three-on-three stars, not borrowed from five-on-five basketball. “where we want to go is professionals who play the whole season,” debove said.  but that just isn’t likely for american players in the near future. “the reality in the short term is that we’ll have five-on-five players who will play three-on-three,” said jim tooley, chief executive of u.s.a. basketball.  “it’s very important to u.s.a. basketball,” tooley said of the three-on-three game. “i love the idea that it gets the sport to parts of the world where otherwise it wouldn’t be.” so the united states is doing its best to adapt to the qualifying system.  “tournaments are at challenging times for the players,” tooley acknowledged. “we can start hosting some events here, to qualify for the olympics. but the big events are not here. we can start a tournament and submit it tomorrow, but it would have very low points.”  in another boost for small nations, the 20 men’s and 20 women’s teams at the world cup must come from 30 different countries. that makes it difficult for countries with strong teams of both genders, like the united states. for this world cup, the american women are in, but the men are out.        fiba is clearly trying to establish the sport, and maintain control of it. it takes pains, for example, to refer to it by its branded name, “3x3,” rather than “three-on-three.” and only official fiba-endorsed 3x3 events count in the rankings, not events like the big3, the league started in the united states by ice cube last summer, for example.  for now, only the women will be representing the americans internationally. the winner of the american qualifying tournament is a team of undergraduates from the university of oregon. arike ogunbowale, who was named most valuable player of the n.c.a.a. tournament, was on a team that lost in the semifinals.  no final decision has been made on how the 2020 olympics qualifiers will be chosen, but placement will be at a premium: there will be only eight teams for each gender. fiba said it would consider adding a qualifying tournament, debove said.  and while bolstering the sports prospects of smaller countries is a laudable goal, fiba is keenly aware that a basketball tournament without the united states is missing something. “a lot of teams want to beat the u.s.,” debove said. “beating the u.s. teams is an achievement.”  this year, nigeria, ukraine and japan won’t get that chance.

       " 'minneapolis — this final four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective, if inadvertent, instances of athlete activism in college sports.  this was when the connecticut star shabazz napier, speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game, said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat.  “there are hungry nights that i go to bed and i’m starving,” he said.  within weeks, the n.c.a.a.’s board of directors for division i voted to  lift  restrictions on how much teams could feed their players. no longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal (notoriously, serving peanuts  did not count , while serving peanut butter did). now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts.  this common-sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually. but the stark comments by a high-profile player at the n.c.a.a.’s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the n.c.a.a.’s power over college athletes.        it is fruitful to remember the efficacy of napier’s comments, because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports’ much-maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within. the players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change.  what would have happened if zion williamson had said, after his nike shoe exploded, jeopardizing his career, that enough was enough, that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by nike? and that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy, either?  “the power is with labor and the players,” said kain colter, the former northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago.  this was most obviously displayed in 2015, when missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired. he stepped down. that the boycott concerned the campus’s racial climate rather than the players’ compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened: the players — unpaid, un-unionized — flexed their muscles, and the system gave in.  vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant. from jackie robinson withstanding taunts, threats and worse to break major league baseball’s color line; to baseball players striking in the 1970s and ’80s to gain and keep full-fledged free agency; to the track standout edwin moses devising benefits for olympic athletes, athletes have often been the ones bringing about change. their leverage is unmatched: they are the ones the fans pay to see, and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit.        and they are the only ones with a steady interest in, well, their own interest.  consider what else has happened since napier’s comments.  colter’s unionization effort, which a national labor relations board regional director endorsed weeks before napier’s final four, was squashed by the overall board.  the antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players.  last month, a second antitrust suit, which sought to explode the n.c.a.a.’s ban on compensation, concluded at the district-court level with a technical victory for players that  looked as much like a victory for the establishment . a federal judge ruled that the n.c.a.a. could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education.  “the courts are not a forum where you’re going to get relief,” said don yee, a sports lawyer and players-rights advocate.            image     before helping uconn beat kentucky in the championship game in 2014, shabazz napier said that he sometimes didn’t have enough to eat. that led the n.c.a.a. to lift restrictions on how much teams could feed players.   credit  ronald martinez/getty images         for yee, who also happens to be tom brady’s agent, the solution is “private entrepreneurialism.” he is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the n.f.l. (which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school). it would be developmental, like college football, but unlike college football, average pay would be $50,000.        a planned summer basketball league, the  historical basketball league , would pay scholarships for its college-level players while enabling them to sell their names, images and likenesses to sponsors. the n.b.a.’s development league plans to offer higher salaries. the probable dissolution of the one-and-done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the n.b.a. instead of having to spend at least a year in college.  a few states, notably north carolina and california, have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if, say, a video game uses their names and likenesses.  all these efforts are well intentioned. but if past is prologue, the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion.  nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition.  at a news conference in minneapolis last week, the n.c.a.a. president, mark emmert, said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports’ governance.  “i’m a lifelong academic,” he said. “i grew up with that tradition, and i never worked at a school that didn’t have students on their board, and they were full voting board members. they voted on my contract, and i think that’s just perfectly appropriate.”  there are athletes serving on several important councils, but there is  not one  on the n.c.a.a. board of governors. no athletes vote on emmert’s contract, which was extended late last year through 2023.  tim nevius, a onetime n.c.a.a. investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system, believes the answer lies with player activism. last month, he announced a new organization, the college athlete advocacy initiative, that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the n.c.a.a. with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players.        he acknowledged in an interview the challenges, including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes, as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power. but he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change.  “there are powers here that the athletes have,” he said, “and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands.”  ros gold-unwude, a turner sports analyst and former stanford basketball player, said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order.  “that’s the way our culture is, where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms,” she said.  “if you’re really struggling or hungry,” she added, “that experience will come out.”  apathy will come out as well, though. beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it, a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets.  napier, who is now a reserve on the nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article, said more during his “hungry nights” speech heard ’round the world, even though it received less publicity.  he noted that there were other wrongs. players’ jerseys were sold to fans, and the players did not receive a cut. more basically, he said, the players were not paid.  it was, he suggested, wrong. probably.  “something can change, something should change,” napier said five years ago. “but if it doesn’t, at the end of the day, we’ve been doing this for so long.”       ',\n",
       " 'it is the go-to comparison in n.b.a. circles whenever the subject turns to the much-debated carmelo anthony experiment in houston. for years, anthony’s critics have wondered: how much longer will it take for him to embrace off-the-bench duty, as bob mcadoo did at 30?  no less an authority than rockets coach mike d’antoni drew that precise parallel on opening night, volunteering to reporters that he hoped anthony would ultimately accept it, in the same reputation-changing manner that mcadoo famously did with the los angeles lakers in the 1980s.  “i know it’s tough,” d’antoni said of the role houston has asked anthony to adopt at 34. but d’antoni quickly added that mcadoo’s having become a two-time champion as a lakers reserve “kind of softens it up a bit.”  but does it? for certain? are we maybe underestimating the size of the challenge involved when a former scoring-machine first option, like melo or doo, is asked to change his mentality so drastically?        the obvious answer: seek out mr. mcadoo and ask him.  i have always been upfront about my buffalo braves fandom, having lived in western new york for nearly all of the braves’ existence, so i naturally enjoy speaking to mcadoo whenever the opportunity presents itself. yet this conversation was not about paying homage to the greatest brave of them all. to get a sense of the adjustment anthony is facing with the struggling rockets, there is perhaps no more qualified expert in the field to talk to than mcadoo.            image     bob mcadoo, center, slips through the defensive action of dallas mavericks bill garnett (20) and jay vincent, left, in a game during the n.b.a. western conference semifinals on april 28, 1984, in los angeles, calif.   credit  associated press photo         he’s still a scout with the miami heat at 67, after many years on the heat bench as an assistant under pat riley, stan van gundy and erik spoelstra. so he is precluded by league rules from discussing anthony or his situation directly. but mcadoo didn’t hesitate to tell me, nearly 40 years since he joined the lakers on christmas eve in 1981, that he had had no advance warning that he would not be a starter in los angeles — and that his three-plus seasons with the lakers’ second unit were harder than he had ever let on.  “it was a great opportunity for me to play with kareem and magic,” mcadoo said. “for the first time in my career, i had a chance to win a championship.  “but i had no thoughts at all in my mind about coming off the bench. it just happened. to me, it was a wrap i would start. they didn’t have anyone who could stick with me at that position.”        yet riley, then coaching the lakers, repeatedly found a forward to start ahead of mcadoo, who had established a league record by winning three scoring titles in buffalo before he turned 25 — but who had also found himself increasingly painted with the “selfish” label as injuries and ringless seasons piled up. the famed boston celtics patriarch red auerbach, in one instance,  told the new york times : “bob was more concerned with personal achievements than team achievements.”  checkered stints with the celtics, the detroit pistons and the new jersey nets led mcadoo to the lakers — only for jim brewer, mark landsberger and ultimately kurt rambis to get turns starting ahead of the league’s 1975 most valuable player.  “but i dealt with it,” mcadoo said, “because i had never been on a championship team. and i’ve never been one to cause disruption or anything like that. i wasn’t happy about it. but what could i do? i was frustrated for four years, but i dealt with it. i never said anything. but i was frustrated with the whole deal.”  during the 1982 playoffs, his first postseason with the lakers, mcadoo was  quoted by the washington post as saying : “that championship is the one thing i don’t have … i’ll do whatever i need to ... get it.” by consistently biting his tongue in the moment and only expounding on that frustration years after the fact, mcadoo highlighted the mind-set that not only won riley’s eternal respect for his sacrifice but also led the game’s historians to view his career with the sort of appreciation and reverence that anthony has only found on the international stage.  olympic melo has won plaudits for his role in helping u.s.a. basketball secure gold medals in 2008, 2012 and 2016, but he’ll have to be a positive force on an n.b.a. title team like eighties mcadoo if he hopes to really change his on-court legacy.  pinning the rockets’ 1-5 start on anthony, mind you, would be grossly unfair. for starters, there have been no indications that he’s putting up any resistance to what d’antoni has asked to him to do. furthermore, chris paul has missed two games because of a suspension, while james harden remains out with a hamstring strain as the most notable of multiple houston injuries. in the wake of losing the savvy wing defense provided by trevor ariza, as well as guidance from the freshly retired defensive coordinator jeff bzdelik, houston was ranked a feeble 27th in the league defensively when d’antoni awoke tuesday morning.        the fact that the rockets are allowing nearly 17 points more per 100 possessions with anthony on the floor only fuels the perception that melo is the one dragging them down. ditto for the fact that anthony’s best offensive game — 24 points in sunday’s home loss to the los angeles clippers — came after he filled in for the ailing harden in the starting lineup.  talking to mcadoo, though, made me wonder if us know-it-alls on the outside underestimate the scale of the experiment. it’s something to think about, at the very least, if the player routinely credited for giving melo his blueprint makes that case.  “it was worth it,” mcadoo said. “but still, looking back, i think we would have been even better with me starting. you say all kinds of things like that in your mind.”  as for sharing such thoughts with riley, mcadoo said he largely held off until they were working side by side in miami — long after the sweet-shooting 1970s precursor to kevin durant had stopped playing.  “he knows,” mcadoo said with a chuckle. “we’ve talked about it. he knows i didn’t like coming off the bench behind kurt.”       ',\n",
       " 'had he stuck to his oft-cited timetable, gregg popovich could have dodged the whole kawhi leonard commotion. the escape path had been established long before this summer’s trade saga that dragged the previously drama-proof san antonio spurs into the n.b.a.’s ever-spinning reality show blender at last.  how many times over the years did popovich tell us he would be walking right out the exit door behind tim duncan when the greatest spur of them all decided to stop playing?  “i kind of believed that,” popovich said the other day in a telephone interview, harkening back to what became one of his go-to proclamations.  “or maybe i was trying to make myself believe it — that i was just going to go out on timmy’s coattails.”        duncan, of course, retired after the 2015-16 season. popovich, the spurs’ coach since 1996, not only has one season remaining on a five-year contract extension he signed in 2014 after san antonio won its last championship — he’s about to start a second job.  on thursday in las vegas, popovich’s tenure as the next coach of the united states men’s basketball team — and the successor to the wildly successful mike krzyzewski — begins in earnest. thirty-five american stars have been invited to two days of light practices and bonding meetings to launch the transition from duke university’s coach k to san antonio’s pop.  “this summer is more about camaraderie than coaching,” popovich said.  that certainly covers the national-team portion of popovich’s off-season, but the rest of it can’t be so neatly summed up. on the court, and especially off it, popovich has never faced a more challenging period.  impervious to player insurrections for nearly two decades — thanks mostly to duncan’s unwavering devotion to the organization after his free-agent flirtation with the orlando magic in 2000 — popovich’s spurs are reeling in the wake of leonard’s departure.  leonard informed the spurs in june that he wanted to be traded and would leave them without compensation in free agency in july 2019 if they didn’t accommodate the request. last wednesday popovich and r.c. buford, the spurs’ president, reluctantly complied.        san antonio  dealt leonard to the toronto raptors  after conceding that popovich, who said he had fielded a similar request for the first time as a coach from the all-star forward lamarcus aldridge last summer, wouldn’t be able to talk his way into a reconciliation as he did with aldridge.  in addition to the unprecedented organizational turmoil, popovich’s return to the floor this week comes amid great personal loss. his wife, erin,  died in april at age 67  after dealing with a long-term illness, which led popovich to step away from the spurs’ final three games in their first-round series with the golden state warriors.  popovich’s re-emergence into the public eye came wednesday at a hastily called news conference after the leonard trade. asked how he had been coping with events both at and away from work, popovich offered a brief acknowledgment that “it’s been difficult.”            image     popovich with leonard in april 2017.   credit  brandon dill/associated press         popovich’s closest friends, then, are understandably hoping that stepping into the u.s. national team role —  his dream job  — can provide a sanctuary from everything else.  “he doesn’t need any advice from me,” said  don nelson , whose bond with popovich dates to pop’s time as an assistant under nelson with golden state in the early 1990s.  “it’s a hard job, but he’s been around this team before,” said nelson, who coached the second incarnation of the so-called dream team at the 1994 world championships. “he knows what to do. hopefully it’ll be good for him.”        popovich was indeed an assistant with the national team, first under george karl and then larry brown, with squads that flopped at the 2002 world championships in indianapolis (finishing sixth) and the 2004 olympics in greece (finishing third). the subsequent decision of u.s.a. basketball’s managing director, jerry colangelo, to name krzyzewski as brown’s replacement, instead of popovich, spurred a frostiness between colangelo and popovich that took a decade to thaw.  but colangelo had only one name in mind when krzyzewski decided he would step down after the 2016 summer games in rio. so he courted popovich hard in 2015 and convinced the former air force academy cadet to add international basketball to his spurs duties. popovich, for the record, agreed to take the job only if colangelo pledged to stay on through the 2020 olympics in tokyo.  “this will probably be good for pop to be able to focus on something a little bit different than spurs business, even if it’s only for a few days,” colangelo said. “i recall with coach k, people would always ask him, ‘how are you going to handle two big jobs at once?’ he always said that it’s not only refreshing but, ‘i need this.’ it kept him re-energized.”  different adjectives may apply if leonard attends the minicamp. all eyes at the open-to-the-media workouts are bound to laser in on every coach-player interaction should popovich and his now-former franchise player wind up in the same gym — especially with demar derozan, san antonio’s prime acquisition in the trade with toronto, also on the list of invitees.  but u.s.a. basketball officials are bracing for leonard to invoke his right to pass on the non-mandatory sessions, as lebron james and stephen curry have done, as he continues his recovery from the mysterious quadriceps injury that led to the unraveling of his relationship with the spurs. leonard, after all, might dread the glare of the spotlight more than popovich.  “he’s a maybe,” colangelo said of leonard’s attending the camp.  popovich, mind you, is not likely to reveal much about any interactions with leonard even if the player does show, whether in front of the audience at u.n.l.v.’s mendenhall center or in private.  those who know popovich best have said he had long been curious about what it would be like to coach beyond duncan, even as he frequently stated publicly that he would retire with him. yet he remains as consistent as any coach the n.b.a. has ever seen — which means you needn’t hold one breath waiting for pop to expound on classified team business.        “i’m not too interested in talking about the past,” popovich said of the leonard situation. “it doesn’t do us any good whatsoever.”  as fiercely patriotic as anyone in basketball, popovich inevitably prefers to focus on the new gig. he turns 70 in january, and suddenly must replace perhaps the most imposing two-way force in the game at his day job, but there was only ever going to be one answer when colangelo proposed doubling his workload.  “it’s an absolutely humbling endeavor and an honor to be asked to do this,” popovich said. “it’s bigger than any one game or any one season.  “i feel that already. i think about it every day to some extent.”       ',\n",
       " 'luka doncic, a leading contender for n.b.a. rookie of the year, expressed dismay friday that his slovenian national team had not been granted automatic entry into next year’s fiba world cup as the reigning eurobasket winners. the team had tried, and failed, to qualify without him.  “i’m so disappointed,” doncic said in an interview after friday’s practice with the dallas mavericks. “we’re the european champions. we should be playing.”  doncic, 19, is averaging 18.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists for the surprising mavericks, quickly affirming dallas’s belief that one of europe’s best young players had instant n.b.a. star potential.  but without doncic playing, slovenia is 2-8 in world cup qualifying with two games to go. under the previous system, the country would automatically have made the world cup, which will be played in several cities across china next summer.        a controversial format change for  the world cup instituted by fiba , basketball’s world governing body, has forced 80 countries to compete for the 31 open slots in the field alongside the tournament host, china, via regional qualifying. it is similar to how the soccer world cup entrants are decided.  two-thirds of the qualifying games, however, clash with the n.b.a. schedule. unlike their soccer counterparts around the world, who are released to their national teams for qualifying matches via what are known as “international breaks,” n.b.a. players and the majority of euroleague players are not allowed to leave their teams during the season to represent their respective countries.  in slovenia’s case, that has meant no doncic, no goran dragic of the miami heat and the need for a new coach.  phoenix suns coach igor kokoskov  had to surrender his slovenia post once he took the suns’ job.  the united states also did not receive an automatic berth for the 2019 world cup as part of the new format — not even as the defending world cup champion and reigning olympic champion. but the americans clinched a spot with a victory sunday in uruguay under coach jeff van gundy, who has posted an 8-2 record in qualifying, relying mostly on players from the n.b.a.’s developmental g league.  thanks to the efforts of van gundy and the 46 players he has used in qualifying thus far, usa basketball will be able to send its usual squad of n.b.a. all-stars to china under san antonio spurs coach gregg popovich, who has replaced duke university’s mike krzyzewski as the full-time national team coach.        led by doncic, dragic and kokoskov, slovenia made a cinderella run to the title at the eurobasket tournament in 2017 — something doncic described as “more amazing than anything in my life.”  “to be european champions and not be in the world cup, it’s tough,” doncic said friday. “i don’t know why they changed it.”  asked how his countrymen were taking it, doncic referred to the fan support slovenia received during its eurobasket run and said: “you saw the final in istanbul. they live for us.”  fiba instituted the soccer-style regional qualifying structure largely with the hope that bringing meaningful home games to every country in the competition — as opposed to summer qualifying tournaments at a centralized location — would help increase interest in the sport. it did so, however, knowing that the best players for numerous countries would not be available to participate.  for slovenia and any other nation that fails to qualify for china, earning a spot in the 2020 olympics in tokyo will be challenging. it will require an invitation to one of four last-chance qualifying tournaments shortly before the olympics start in 2020. only the four bracket winners in those tournaments will advance to tokyo.  doncic acknowledged that leading slovenia to its first-ever olympic berth in basketball is one of his major career goals.  “olympics, next eurobasket, next world cup — i want to play for the national team whenever i’m available,” doncic said. “if i don’t have injuries, i’ll play.”       ',\n",
       " 'durham, n.c. — it is difficult to reconcile the awe that comes out of the mouths of adults about zion williamson when you’re watching the player slumped in a chair after a 33-point blowout victory, answering goofy questions with a goofy smile.  “did you feel like a tight end on that breakaway?”  “is it true you were offered scholarships to play football?”  “do you feel pressure to put on a show when you get the ball?”  williamson, duke’s star freshman and (many expect) a no. 1 n.b.a. draft pick by june, had just turned in the kind of performance against yale that college hoops aficionados have come to expect from him: 20 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and the requisite head-above-the-rim tomahawk dunk that has made him a staple of television highlight reels and internet video compilations.  after absorbing each question, williamson looked at his teammate mike buckmire, who pretended he was playing the role of williamson’s consigliere.        buckmire nodded for him to answer.  no, williamson said, he did not feel like a tight end.  yes, he had received offers to play football. “they are not exaggerating — i did pick up a couple of football scholarships,” he said.  as for his rim-rattling performance art?  “if it’s there, i’m going to do it, because i like to put on a show,” he said with yet another big smile.  in fact, everything about williamson is big.  at 6 feet 7 inches and 285 pounds, he is not only paul bunyan-esque for the college ranks but also, the website fivethirtyeight  noted , heavier than all but one active n.b.a. player. williamson, however, is hardly earthbound. his 45-inch vertical leap is the highest since duke started measuring its players, providing the foundation for his explosive moves to the basket — and the reason at least one reporter  spoke with a physicist  to try to calculate the damage a force like williamson can cause to those who get in his way.            image     williamson is 6 feet 7 inches and 285 pounds, heavier than all but one active n.b.a. player, but his 45-inch vertical leap is the highest since duke started measuring its players.   credit  grant halverson/getty images north america         while n.b.a. teams long ago took note of williamson’s skill set — espn published  an n.b.a. draft preview  of him before he had thrown down his first dunk for duke — it is online where his legend was made and where it continues to grow.        youtube channels like  ballislife  first started spreading the gospel of zion when he was a high school star in spartanburg, s.c., uploading his raw clips and declaring him the “best mixtape player of our generation.”          so it is little wonder that williamson has  2.1 million    followers  on instagram or that his time with the second-ranked blue devils (9-1) is likely to be short.  nor is it surprising that just 10 games into his collegiate career he is being compared to onetime basketball man-children and subsequent n.b.a. all-stars like shawn kemp and charles barkley.  barkley, a hall of famer, was known as the round mound of rebound at auburn, where his playing weight was about the same as williamson’s now. but barkley insisted the similarities ended there. williamson, he said, is “way more explosive.”  “my weight was fat,” barkley told the radio host dan patrick recently. “i don’t think he’s got fat weight on him.”  jay bilas, the espn commentator and former duke forward, does not dare compare williamson to lebron james, but he said that he has not been as bowled over by a natural talent since he first saw james 16 years ago, when he was part of the broadcast team for james’s first  nationally televised game .        “there has never been anyone like zion at any level,” bilas said. “there has never been anyone of his size who can move like him.”            image        williams celebrates with fellow freshman r.j. barrett, who is probably his biggest challenger for the top spot in next year’s n.b.a. draft.   credit  ben mckeown/associated press         duke coach mike krzyzewski, too, said williamson is like no player he has come across in a 44-year career filled with top picks, national championships and olympic gold medals.  “he is just a unique athlete, and i think part of that is that he was a point guard up until eighth grade,” krzyzewski said. “he has the ability to handle the ball and to drive without charging, and his second jump — it’s extraordinary how quickly he gets up and gets his miss on any kind of drive.”  williamson absorbed the intricacies of backcourt play from his stepfather, lee anderson, who played at clemson, before a growth spurt remade his game and his future in it. in the summer between eighth and ninth grade, williamson grew from 5-foot-9 to 6-foot-3. he continued to fill out through high school.  in the blue devils’ season-opening game against kentucky, he displayed his varied skill set over a 27-second stretch in which he made a 3-pointer, slashed to the basket for a thunderous dunk, blocked a shot and then, on the run, threaded a bounce pass through traffic to his teammate r.j. barrett, another freshman and probably his biggest challenger for the top spot in next year’s n.b.a. draft.  among williamson’s 20 points against yale was a balletic layup on which he appeared to float through a thicket of elis before softly dropping the ball through the basket, but also yet another  thunderous dunk . in between, he threw at least one nifty pass to barrett, who poured in 30 points.        “both are phenomenal,” bilas said. “but zion will sell more tickets.”  one of the intangibles that krzyzewski particularly enjoys is williamson’s joyfulness. it is on display in pregame warm-ups, when the big man with a guard’s mentality alternates high-wattage smiles with acrobatic dunks and all manner of fist bumps and hand slaps with his teammates.  the joy was palpable in the waning moments of the yale blowout here, when williamson — his afternoon complete — remained on his feet in front of the duke bench, offering full-throated support to the extras taking a rare turn in the cameron indoor stadium spotlight.  the joy was there as the locker room was closing later, too, after williamson decided to release buckmire,  a walk-on and pre-med student , from his consigliere duties. williamson swallowed buckmire into his arms, and for a moment, the 6-2, 170-pound guard disappeared.  “you are good at this,” williamson said amid muffled laughter.

       " 'maybe it all would have turned out differently for carmelo anthony, produced a narrative arc with more illustrious inflection points, had joe dumars done anthony and the detroit pistons the pleasure of drafting him with the second pick of the celebrated 2003 n.b.a. draft.  fate can be forbidding. a team’s general manager can be foolish. dumars followed cleveland’s no-brainer selection of lebron james by going big for darko milicic, the 7-footer from serbia who seldom escaped coach larry brown’s bench and doghouse as the already formidable pistons rolled to a championship the following june.  chauncey billups, the adult in detroit’s locker room and the pilot of its egalitarian offense,  addressed this issue  of an alternative anthony history a few years ago with my former colleague, howard beck. he was as blunt as he was convinced.  “that ball-stopping mentality that carmelo has?” billups said. “he wouldn’t have had that if he was a piston. we wouldn’t let him play like that. he would have been a much better player than he is now — and he’s a great player now.”        not great enough to please the many critics of anthony’s total game, the 15-year summary of which would be: tantalizing sizzle, not enough steak. and not willing enough at age 34 to adapt and stick with a houston team he begged the knicks to trade him to over the 2016 summer.  a houston team, by the way, with a close friend, chris paul, who surely had a private say in  the rockets’ decision to part ways with anthony  after what amounted to a 10-game tryout.  like anthony, paul wasn’t all that special as the rockets stumbled early. yes, james harden was hurt. but when your best pal — who, in paul’s case, is an outspoken leader and president of the players’ union — isn’t publicly decrying this ouster as a miscarriage of n.b.a. justice, something clearly went terribly awry, no matter what spin-room platitudes were recently mouthed by the rockets.  hours after the official statement of separation was released thursday night, the rockets responded by routing the stephen curry-less golden state warriors.        houston, we read you, between the lines.  what happened?  instead of joining those pistons in 2003, anthony was selected third over all by the denver nuggets, a team that had won 17 games the previous season (coached by jeff bzdelik, who coincidentally, or not, is returning now to the rockets as defensive coach after a brief absence). anthony was immediately given the latitude to isolate and jab-step his man on the wing to his heart’s content. the nuggets won 43 games and he was hailed — not wrongly — as the franchise savior.            image     anthony scored in bunches for the nuggets, who drafted him third over all in the 2003 draft.   credit  ray stubblebine/reuters         on a national level, he was included in many conversations of next gen transcendence. as explosive a scorer as he was, anthony didn’t belong in that category then, or ever, because historic-level greatness requires full recognition of what makes the team, not just you, excel.  “melo doesn’t get an a in that department — maybe not much more than a b minus,” george karl, who coached anthony for the majority of his time in denver,  told the times in 2014 . “it is, in a sense, the a.a.u. mind-set: we worked hard yesterday, maybe we can take a day off today. that’s why he really needs that player — the point guard or someone who takes on that role — to be the bridge from the coach to him.”  that player in denver turned out to be billups, whose arrival from detroit helped anthony and the nuggets end a string of first-round playoff defeats along the way to the 2009 western conference finals.  the argument over whether anthony’s teams — mainly denver and the knicks — failed him with substandard personnel during his prime, or whether he was not up to the task of pulling others along, will rage forever. it isn’t the fairest evidence by which to measure, or judge.  for the most part, anthony’s teammates adored or appreciated him. as an n.b.a. ambassador, he was among the first to speak up on social issues, a now popular trend.        every contemporary n.b.a. star, with the obvious exception of tim duncan, works on his brand, but anthony often seemed preoccupied with it when he might have been more focused on his game, or his team.  when he leveraged the nuggets to trade him to the knicks in february 2011, he missed the memo — authored by lebron james and chris bosh when they joined dwyane wade in miami — that happiness was not to be found with a team stripped of talent in order to make room for you.  playing for mike d’antoni in new york, he made a mountain out of the jeremy lin molehill. wanting to participate in the 2015 all-star game at madison square garden, he seemed to care more about a glorified exhibition than making the earliest return possible from looming surgery.            image        anthony’s ball-stopping mentality often slowed down the knicks’ offense.   credit  kathy willens/associated press         when given the opportunity to flee the knicks after their 17-win disaster of a 2014-15 season, he deluded himself into thinking things would quickly improve because he relished being the man in new york. when the team president at the time, phil jackson, turned on him, blaming anthony for jackson’s own miscalculations on almost everything, including anthony, he comfortably embraced the martyr within instead of taking on jackson.  as his body rebelled, as the league moved away from his style of isolation play, victimhood became anthony’s fallback position.  an out-of-date game and a bad attitude  the experts postulated that he would work well with oklahoma city last season, a cool-hand sidekick to russell westbrook and paul george, reprising the role he played on three olympic gold-medal teams. but being part of one big happy family is much easier when the competition lives on other continents.        in the evolving n.b.a., land of high-screen-and-roll, offenses relentlessly targeted anthony, attacked him off the dribble. how the rockets convinced themselves that anthony would fit after the thunder’s first-round playoff series loss to utah last spring is the mystery of 2018.  lateral movement is one thing. lousy attitude on display is another. did houston’s front office not see anthony arguing on the sideline with the assistant coach maurice cheeks — to re-enter a playoff elimination game in which the thunder were rallying from 25 points behind without him?  “i’m not sacrificing no bench role,” he said when that series was over. “that’s out of the question.”  a little more than a year ago, anthony was grousing over espn’s rating him the league’s 64th-best player. now he’s a full-fledged journeyman, vince carter with a weaker grasp on reality.  no doubt the melo redemption tour, thus far fruitless, will continue. he will sign somewhere soon, most likely with a team that is longer on expectation than on roster depth. maybe this latest rockets episode and rejection will trigger a necessary introspection that allows him to yet be a useful scorer on a playoff team.  until it does, until he is, it’s all wishful thinking, like a reimagined version of the 2003 draft.

       " 'east burke, vt. — after nearly 50 years of training and educating promising ski racers, burke mountain academy has its first students from china.  “we have two this year, but i think we could easily fill half our school with chinese students right now,” said willy booker, the academy’s head of school.  the explanation for the surge in interest? mikaela shiffrin, who attended burke, an elite and expensive boarding school in the bucolic corner of vermont known as the northeast kingdom.         with beijing set to host the next winter olympics in 2022, the chinese are pursuing proven methods of developing their alpine skiing talent.            image     a poster in the communal room at burke mountain academy with photos of mikaela shiffrin, an olympic champion.    credit  john tully for the new york times         what better template at this stage than shiffrin, who with 56 world cup victories at age 23 appears well on her way to becoming the most prolific winner in the sport’s history?  after claiming the last two world cup overall titles, she is in the midst of what could turn out to be her most dominant season. she won the super-g title at the world championships in are, sweden, last week, and after surprisingly choosing to skip the combined event and the downhill, it would come as no surprise if she won two more golds this week, with the giant slalom on thursday and slalom on saturday.  “the chinese people look at the sport and see mikaela, and they quickly figure out that her path came through burke, and they see that as an opportunity,” said booker as he leaned on his poles between runs last wednesday and observed his student body in action on the same steep slope where shiffrin polished her talent.  “she skied thousands of runs on this same trail,” booker said.  song wenmiao and zhang dingyue, the academy’s 14-year-old newcomers from beijing, are hardly the only students who are deeply attuned to this. shiffrin’s legacy looms large at burke.            image        annaliese fleck, 17, a junior, works on her skis on campus.    credit  john tully for the new york times          image        students and faculty listen to

cited in classrooms and on the mountain. her biggest successes are hailed during the daily announcements at lunch in the dining hall with its wooden beams and dangling flags representing the home nations of academy students, known as burkies. they regularly watch and study her races on their phones, sometimes while riding ski lifts during training.  “i’d say her impact is certainly huge just on everyone,” said charlie lang, a senior from norwich, vt., who is one of the 68 current students, 18 of whom are international students. “it’s really cool to see burke can produce something as successful as she is. i think it makes it more comfortable, more familiar. i think it just gives us some hope to do what she has. same hills. same places. same classrooms. same dorms. same teachers.”  and yet there are few images of shiffrin on display at the academy, a conscious effort by the school’s leadership to send an egalitarian message.            image        “everybody involved in ski racing in america should be concerned about the overall rise in the cost of participation in the sport,” said willy booker, the academy’s head of school.   credit  john tully for the new york times         “i try not to make her into a snow goddess or some sort of snow princess,” said david chamberlain, her former history teacher. “i kind of cringe when i see that language. i think it’s the antithesis of what we’re trying to do here. this is vermont. i think the school and most of the staff really prides itself on trying to be humble people, and there are a lot of tremendously successful people here but they carry it lightly.”        chamberlain, a big admirer of shiffrin’s work ethic and talent, said there had been some discussion about how much the school should feature shiffrin on its website because her accomplishments can be an intimidating and extremely tough act to follow.   burke is undeniably elite. the full annual cost for a boarding student is listed at $57,891. additional costs — like coaching and race fees, travel, equipment and training camps — can add $20,000 or more to tuition costs. booker said that 40 percent of the students receive some financial aid and estimated that “15 percent receive very significant financial aid.”  “it’s a lot,” said booker, a burke graduate, of the full-tuition price. “everybody involved in ski racing in america should be concerned about the overall rise in the cost of participation in the sport.”  there are numerous ski academies in the united states, but burke was the first of its kind in this country when warren witherell founded it near the base of burke mountain resort in 1970 with a single student, martha coughlin, who was looking for a way to train full time.  the academy’s alumni now include 36 olympians. diann roffe won a gold medal in the giant slalom at the 1985 world    championships when she was still enrolled at the academy and went on to win gold in the super-g at the 1994 winter olympics.  but burke has not seen anyone quite like shiffrin, the daughter of ski racers who was born in vail, colo., and moved to new hampshire with her family at age 8. she came to the academy in middle school when her older brother, taylor, enrolled. though she spent most of her last two years of high school racing internationally, she graduated with her class in 2013.            image

are responsible for maintaining and tuning their ski equipment.   credit  john tully for the new york times        now based in vail again, shiffrin has remained an active alumna, lending her voice to a series of instructional videos for the academy and extolling the long-term virtues of carving turns on the often hard-packed, icy trails of vermont, which have much more in common with european world cup racecourses than the abundant powder of the american west.  shiffrin last returned in may 2016 for a farewell celebration for the academy’s departing headmaster, kirk dwyer, one of her former coaches. he is now executive director of ski and snowboard club vail.  charlotte maurer, an 18-year-old senior, said she was able to talk to shiffrin about their similar hard workouts and their favorite memories at the academy.   “i thought that was really cool that even though she’s on top of the world, she can still get down to earth and talk about the same things we have all struggled with,” maurer said.   things like the green mountain relay, a 211-mile event in the spring in which students run a relay the length of vermont through the night along route 100 from the massachusetts border to the canadian border at north troy.  tradition endures at burke mountain academy. there are still no letter grades, only written evaluations. students are responsible for cleaning their dormitories, maintaining and tuning their ski equipment and taking part in regular kitchen duty.        but there also have been significant changes since shiffrin graduated, and not just in the staff.  the single-rider poma lift that long served the primary training hill has been replaced by a higher-speed t-bar that can accommodate two skiers at a time and increase the number of repetitions athletes can pack into a morning session.            image        burke mountain academy has produced 36 olympians.   credit  john tully for the new york times         back on the academy grounds, a short walk downhill from the resort, there is now campuswide wi-fi and a capacious indoor training facility, the ronnie berlack center, which opened in december 2015 and serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers of alpine skiing.  berlack, a 20-year-old alumnus, and bryce astle, 19, were killed in an avalanche in sölden, austria, on jan. 5, 2015, while free skiing on an off day from training with the u.s. ski team’s development squad. berlack and shiffrin trained together at the academy.   “he used to hate it when she’d beat him,” steve berlack, ronnie’s father, said. “they built a lot of speed chasing each other.  though shiffrin’s serial success runs the risk of making her less relatable to current students, berlack, a longtime coach at burke, believes there are still lessons to pass on.  “you might not be able to ski like mikaela or have the results of mikaela,” berlack said. “but you can go to bed when she did. you can eat like she did. you can do recovery like she did, take care of your equipment like she did, focus on your mental strength like she did. and all those things make a difference.”        amid the academy’s upgrades, there is uncertainty about the future. the burke mountain resort has been in government-appointed receivership since 2016, when the securities and exchange commission took control of it following a fraud investigation. “we are hopeful we’ll get a good owner who understands not just b.m.a. but the local community here,” booker said.  the academy’s appeal for nearly half a century has been rooted in its on-site access to top-flight ski runs, which allow students to train all morning and then study all afternoon.  “without this, the school doesn’t exist,” booker said, pointing at the training hill in the february sunshine.  shiffrin is a unique selling point, but the template has its limits, whether you arrive from nearby burlington or faraway beijing.  “there are a lot of things that are really special about burke, and i don’t want to say that there aren’t,” booker said. “but there are also a lot of things that are really special about mikaela shiffrin.”           mikaela shiffrin wows skiing when she races — and when she

       " 'madrid — as a child, carolina marín was drawn to badminton because of its oddness, an attraction that grew once she switched from plastic shuttlecocks to the ones used for competition, each made of 16 feathers  plucked from the left wings  of geese.  “in tennis, a ball is a ball, but trying to control these feathers just felt really weird,” she said.  now marín, 25, is something of an oddity herself.  in august, she became the first woman to win  three world singles championships . at the 2016 olympic games, she became the first european woman  to win a gold medal  in badminton, ending the longstanding domination of asian players. the feat was all the more remarkable because spain had no track record in badminton: before marín, only one spanish player had ever won a match at the olympics.  “playing badminton, i’ve always known what i wanted to do and i’ve been willing to train very hard for it, even when it’s got physically painful,” marín said. “those who watch me train say that i’m a bit ‘bruta,’” she added, using a spanish word for rough.        “i think the fact that more people now recognize me when i’m crossing the street in jakarta and other places in asia than in my own country shows in itself just how much effort i’ve had to make to get to where i am,” she said.            image     marín is the first woman to win three world singles championships.   credit  kazuhiro nogi/agence france-presse — getty images         marín has risen through the world rankings with the help of a spanish national coach, fernando rivas, who spotted her talent at a tournament when she was 13. rivas persuaded marín’s parents to let her leave the family home in huelva, in southern spain, to train with him at madrid’s national sports center.  there, marín’s skill and single-mindedness, and rivas’s coaching, helped her develop into the world’s best player.   rivas said that marín stood out as a teenager not only because of her exceptional speed, but also because of her ability to change pace and “read the game” in a way few young players can. badminton, he said, demands explosive movements but also relies heavily on deception, akin to the way a volleyball player jumps and pretends to ready a violent smash — only to change direction or gently loop the ball over the net.        during a morning training session in october, marín moved back and forth relentlessly between the net and the back line of the court in one drill, returning the shots of her practice partners, who alternated drop shots and lobs. at other times, she is the one changing the pace.  “i’m a quick and aggressive player who’s always looking to keep the opponent under pressure,” she said. “if you compare tennis and badminton, we play on a smaller court, with a shuttlecock that crosses the net faster than a ball, so that makes our sport much more explosive — and that suits me just fine.”  marín won her first world championship title in 2014, overcoming a stress fracture in her foot  that had left her, a week before the competition, wondering if she would be fit enough to play at all.            image        marín often trains against men. other women, she said, \"can’t cope with my pace.”   credit  samuel aranda for the new york times             image        marín with her longtime coach, fernando rivas, after winning her third world title in august.   credit  mark schiefelbein/associated press         when she did play, and  won , her triumph caught the spanish federation so unprepared that it ignited  an open feud  over who should reap the financial benefits from the surprising victory. federation officials tried to force marín to cede her suddenly marketable commercial rights to the organization. when she refused, the federation escalated the dispute by withdrawing spain’s team from a european tournament.  marín eventually prevailed, keeping control of her commercial rights. and while her advisers would not disclose her precise earnings, they said she had collected more from about 10 sponsorship contracts than the $578,000 in tournament prize money that she had accumulated in her career.        she has made peace with the federation, too, even if she remains critical of the sport’s administrators in spain, and particularly their failure to promote badminton more extensively in light of her success. the number of licensed players in spain last year had climbed to only about 7,800, from 6,000 a decade earlier.  “badminton could be a lot more popular, but i really don’t know what all the people in the federation are doing — or if they’re doing the work that should be done,” marín said. the federation, she said, remains “disconnected” from the players, to the point that officials still do not watch her and other top players train in madrid.  but dismal participation numbers might have worked in marín’s favor at the start of her career, because she could stand out faster than athletes growing up in countries with more established national programs, coaching methods and hierarchies.            image        marín at the 2016 olympics, where she defeated p.v. sindhu of india to win the gold medal.   credit  chang w. lee/the new york times         anders thomsen, who has worked with rivas as a coach for marín since 2008, said she was “probably lucky there wasn’t a real structure for badminton in spain” at the beginning of her career. thomsen played and then coached in his native denmark, one of the few european countries where badminton is among the most popular sports. in his home city, viborg, thomsen said, there are seven badminton clubs that nurture players at least until they turn 18, after which the best move on to train under the supervision of the national federation.  “carolina found herself at 14 getting all the possible attention within a national center,” thomsen said, “because there really was nobody better than her in spain.”   these days, marín’s unmatched skill means that she practices against nationally ranked male players, rather than the two other female players at madrid’s national center.        “if i was training with the other girls, the quality of the training would fall a lot because they can’t cope with my pace,” marín said. “of course i would love to have the opportunity that others have in asia, to have several other girls of a high level with whom to train. we’ve spoken for a while with the federation about bringing some foreign players over, but it’s not that easy to do.”  one of her sparring partners, alvaro vázquez, described marín as an inspiration, while acknowledging a similar frustration that her success had not translated into a broader appreciation in spain of the complexity of badminton.             image        marín, who once feuded openly with spain’s national federation, trains at its center in madrid.   credit  samuel aranda for the new york times         “i think most people in spain still think of badminton as something that you play for fun on the beach,” he said, “when in fact, you can’t really play on the beach because of the wind.”  rivas, who continues to oversee the national team, is not optimistic that he or the federation will find another spaniard capable of following in marín’s footsteps, at least not in the way spain has produced an armada of highly ranked tennis players, led for more than a decade by rafael nadal.  “i don’t think that spain will find another carolina in 1,000 years,” rivas said. “my main job is not to find another star, but maintain the one that we have.”

       " \"paris — anabel medina garrigues guided jelena ostapenko through a  fairy-tale run to the french open title  last year. she is back at roland garros this year hoping to find a happy ending for herself.  medina garrigues, who ended her coaching relationship with ostapenko in october, entered the women’s doubles and mixed doubles events at the french open, three weeks after beginning her comeback in madrid.  on wednesday, she and arantxa parra santonja won their opening-round match in 2 hours 22 minutes, beating johanna konta and alison riske, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3). on thursday with marcel granollers, medina garrigues lost in the first round of the mixed doubles event, 6-2, 6-2, against kristina mladenovic and alexis musialek.  “i was trying to find the perfect moment to do it,” medina garrigues, 35, said of her comeback.  her success with ostapenko was a somewhat unplanned detour from her playing career. medina garrigues sustained a right shoulder injury at wimbledon in 2016, partially dislocating the joint. eager to participate in the rio de janeiro olympics the next month, medina garrigues pushed through the pain, which ultimately left her unable to raise her arm to serve in the weeks afterward.        she stopped playing the week before the united states open that august, after winning only one game in a loss at a tournament in new haven, conn.  “normally with the injury that i have, you should immobilize the shoulder for two to three weeks,” she said. “i couldn’t because i had to play the olympics. after that, i had a frozen shoulder, losing all mobility in the shoulder. so it’s like i had two injuries. it takes four or five months to recover all the feelings in the shoulder.”  at an age when many players would consider retirement, medina garrigues was determined not to let the injury decide when her career ended.  “i couldn’t retire then in a good way, playing at my best level,” she said. “so i had that on my mind already, to come back to play some tournaments to have a good retirement on the court.”  medina garrigues opted for a conservative rehabilitation process, without surgery. in the midst of that process came an offer from ostapenko, with whom she shared an agent, to come on the tour as a coach.        the two started together at a wta tournament in prague in april of last year, with little inkling that a grand slam title was weeks away.            image     anabel medina garrigues, second from left, was jelena ostapenko's coach last year when ostapenko won the french open.   credit  gabriel bouys/agence france-presse — getty images         “what she did was something unbelievable,” medina garrigues said of ostapenko’s title in paris. “it was a big surprise for everybody, because she came here as no. 46 in the world. she was not in anyone’s plans of who wins the tournament — that’s true, we’re realistic about that.”  medina garrigues, who reached a high of no. 16 in singles and no. 3 in doubles, was herself a french open doubles champion in 2008 and 2009 with virginia ruano pascual. she said the satisfaction of ostapenko’s win was “pretty close to the titles that i won as a player.”  “i was looking at her and seeing that she did something i never could do, so i was very proud of her,” medina garrigues said.  ostapenko, who prefers to called alona, was able to consolidate her successes, reaching the quarterfinals of wimbledon and semifinals of prominent wta tournaments in wuhan, china, and then beijing. but after the beijing event in october, medina garrigues told ostapenko of her desire to pursue her own path back to the tour.  “i spoke with her because i had already had a lot of conversations with myself,” she said. “because i had this on my mind: what i am going to feel if i don’t retire playing on the court? it was really tough for me to make that decision, because what i didn’t want was in the future, to be staying at home regretting that i didn’t retire on the court.”        the decision coincided with another attractive offer: the spanish fed cup captaincy. unlike ostapenko, who had wanted medina garrigues to focus solely on their work together, the spanish federation was happy to have her finish her playing career while holding the fed cup position.  medina garrigues and ostapenko’s successful partnership was followed by another spanish woman piloting major success: conchita martinez, the previous fed cup captain for spain, guided garbiñe muguruza to  last year’s wimbledon title  while her primary coach, sam sumyk, was home with his expecting wife.  medina garrigues said more wta players should enlist the help of former players, who often offer insights that those who haven’t played cannot.  “we have the experience, we remember the feelings that we had, what was working and what was not working,” she said. “that’s an advantage to help the players. in this case i was trying to say to alona the experience that i had, and what i was doing when i was with no confidence, or with confidence.”  she said being a woman also helped. “in the case of female players, we understand more what the girls are thinking,” medina garrigues said. “i’m a girl, so i know the feelings, the pressure, the thoughts.”  now, she gets to feel those feelings all over again.  “i’m happy to be on the court again,” she said.       \",\n",
       " 'in a closed city in central russia that once made atomic bombs, there is a sports school churning out olympic hopefuls.       photographs and text by   maxim babenko       it takes 10 minutes to drive from the military checkpoint, where anyone who has a pass to the city must stop, to an ice-filled stadium called trud (work).  since the days of the soviet union, there have been several dozen closed cities like lesnoy, a community of 50,000 where access is tightly controlled and state secrets are protected. for decades, those not in on the secrets did not know about these cities at all.  inside, however, citizens were hard at work: developing weapons of mass destruction, processing radioactive materials — and training for the olympics.  according to local officials, the number of olympians per resident here is a record for the country. lesnoy has given rise to 46 champions of the u.s.s.r., russia and europe, and has produced 11 athletes who competed at the olympic games and went home with medals.        it was on the ice of trud, inside this closed city built by gulag prisoners 70 years ago, that many of them got their start.            image     a view looking out from within the closed city of lesnoy. access to the city, which once made atomic weapons, is tightly controlled.        when you’re walking around the city, which used to be known as sverdlovsk-45 before the u.s.s.r. collapsed and the city was declassified and renamed, it can seem as if you are in a separate socialist state. there are numerous buildings in the style of soviet neo-classicism, a monument to lenin and, since the 1950s, an atomic bomb production factory. the main plant, now called the combine elektrokhimpribor, is used to assemble and dispose of nuclear ammunition and to produce uranium isotopes. one of every three inhabitants of the city works inside.  but it is the fakel (torch) olympic sports school that has made lesnoy famous. the school trains children from 9 to 17 years old for various sports: speedskating and cross-country skiing and shooting, ice hockey and the rest. many closed cities developed powerful sports organizations over the years to fill children’s free time; today, there are about 1,000 at the fakel school.              lyubov pronina has worked as a speedskating coach in lesnoy since 1974. “for me, work is my life,” she said. pronina’s son sergey pronin is also a coach. he competed in the russian championships in 2007 and was a mentor for the youth national team. vasiliy pudushkin, a bronze medalist of the first youth olympic games in austria in 2012, was one of his trainees.        pronin’s oldest daughter, paulina, 15, already has reached the first adult rank in skating. her sister, uliana, 5, skates, too. but the pronin family is not alone in creating its own lesnoy sports dynasty.  “the city is small,” he said. “what else shall we do?”            image        speedskating students take part in indoor training at trud stadium.            image        hockey players on their way home from practice.        the most significant problem for speedskaters here is the lack of financing. “we have to collect money from parents for all trips and equipment,” lyubov pronina said. “a jumpsuit costs 30,000 rubles, and dutch skates are even more expensive. you can’t win the competition without it!”  the ski base is on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by the forest on one side and a barbed wire perimeter on the other.  vladimir popov was the mentor of many champions, and even though he is retired, he still comes to the ski base to meet with the skiers and their coaches.            image        a skiing student waxes his skis.            image        gas pipes on the outskirts of the city.        but lesnoy is a start now, not a destination. many athletes in the fakel school leave the city after finishing high school. some apply to join national sportsteams, but many of them simply quit professional sports and get on with their lives.  “there is nothing to do in the city,” said 16-year-old lisa sharova. even though lisa’s father was also in speedskating, and helped her get started in the sport, she doesn’t plan to spend her life on skates.  “i realized,” she said, “that i’d have a better chance if i became a coding specialist.”  for dmitri nikishkin, a participant in the nagano and salt lake city paralympic games, the situation was different. nikishkin honed his skiing under the supervision of popov, while studying at the local university and practicing at the factory.              in january 1998, he won a specialized russian championship at two distances: 10 kilometers and 20 kilometers. but he didn’t get any olympic or world cup medals.        a year after the salt lake city games, in 2003, nikishkin quit sports. “i used to come back from camps, see my son and leave again. it was hard. in the end, i decided to finish my career. my son is my main medal.”  isolated from large cities and world news, lesnoy exists in its own world, with its passes, its competitions — and its problems.  “if you ask me about the russian doping scandal, i will answer: we, in general, don’t care about these political games,” sergey pronin said with a laugh. “we just want to buy new skates!”            image        skaters prepare in the locker room.         ivan chesnokov contributed reporting.

       " 'it is wednesday evening at rush hour and mikaela shiffrin, perhaps the most dominant athlete in the world, strolled unobserved through a crowded central park.  after shattering a host of records on the just completed alpine skiing world cup tour — most victories in a season (17); most career women’s slalom wins (40); only skier to claim the overall, super-g, giant slalom and slalom championship in one winter — shiffrin arrived in new york for a round of appearances on morning and late-night television talk shows.  since she is obscured by a helmet and reflective goggles while competing in a sport mostly contested in europe, it could be a given that she would not draw much attention during a casual walkabout in her native country.  but that may soon change.  with  lindsey vonn’s retirement  last month, shiffrin, at 24, is the unquestioned face of american ski racing. moreover, her ever-escalating, dazzling accomplishments are becoming so outrageous, she has a chance to enlarge the crossover celebrity status that vonn achieved.        consider this: in addition to the 10 olympic and world championship medals shiffrin has already won, she is on a pace to win as many as 125 world cup races, or 39 more than the current career record.            image     shiffrin after winning the silver medal in the alpine combined event at 2018 olympics in pyeongchang, south korea.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         that would be like rewriting baseball’s record book by hitting 1,107 career home runs.  when such a staggering possibility was explained to shiffrin as she tranquilly ate dinner at a clamorous midtown manhattan restaurant, she shook her head. she smiled but nonetheless looked pained.  “as soon as i start acting like i’m the pied piper of ski racing,” she said, “that’s when things are going to go wrong.”  and yet, off the snow, shiffrin has embraced her role as the sport’s archetype. she has spent recent months energetically conducting news interviews, stoking her social media platforms and bolstering her many notable commercial sponsors, who see her as the bridge to a younger generation of skiers because her career could last another decade.        in another step that required the naturally shy shiffrin to adapt to a more prominent role, she has tried to mentor younger or less experienced racers on the american women’s team. it came at the urging of top officials on the united states ski team, who in early 2018 surprised shiffrin by asking if she had considered what her legacy might be.  answered shiffrin: “my legacy? i’m 23 years old. i might not even be halfway through my career yet.”  the conversation continued, and shiffrin better understood the question.  “it wasn’t about developing a legacy but more about trying to figure out how my role can be beneficial to the whole team,” shiffrin said wednesday. “it’s not enough to have one face of american ski racing. you want many faces. you want a team that is the best in the world.”            image        shiffrin racing at the world cup finals in soldeu, andorra, on sunday.   credit  albert gea/reuters         the united states ski team is currently anything but atop the ski racing rankings. shiffrin’s incandescent season helped mask the struggles behind her. shiffrin was the only american to win a world cup race in the 2018-19 season, and only vonn made it to a post-race podium as well, placing third in the downhill at the world championships, the final race of her career.  as she pondered how she could help, shiffrin decided she could especially offer advice and guidance on acclimating to the pressure of the world cup, because she joined the tour when she was 16.  “it is a highly intimidating atmosphere,” shiffrin said. “when i came to the world cup, i can remember starting way at the back of giant slalom races and thinking to myself, ‘i don’t belong here.’ and i didn’t want to race.”        shiffrin has tried to keep her younger teammates from feeling similarly.  “the most important thing is for me to reach out enough so they know there’s a place they can go to feel safe,” she said. “we can talk. we want the team to be a nurturing environment.”  but unlike the vast majority of racers, shiffrin has the versatility to enter multiple events at a variety of international venues, which means that she is frequently on the move and on a different training schedule from her teammates. that diminishes her contact with parts of the team. she also has her own staff of coaches, which includes her mother, eileen.  but tiger shaw, the president and chief executive of u.s. ski and snowboard, said he had watched shiffrin find a way to make the newest team members feel at ease.            image        shiffrin, center, on the podium for winning the world cup super-g season title. with her are austria’s nicole schmidhofer, who finished second, and liechtenstein’s tina weirather, who was third.   credit  albert gea/reuters         “it’s not easy because they’re coming from two completely different places,” shaw said. “but i’ve seen mikaela really learn how to bridge that gap.”  shiffrin’s obligations have also grown as a fund-raiser for the ski team, which counts on donations for 30 percent of its budget.  “she’s the centerpiece of a lot of events that have raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars,” shaw said. “with her increasing star power, she will become more valuable, but it will also be more difficult because everybody only has 365 days a year on earth and she uses about 250 of them to be on snow.”        that schedule, shiffrin insisted, will not change.  “i don’t know if i’m ever going to win as many races in one season as i just did,” she said. “but i know i won’t prepare and practice any less.”  that comment called to mind a time the precocious shiffrin said she would never think of herself as ahead of schedule.  “that’s right, i always feel like i’m behind,” she said wednesday with a sheepish grin.  indeed, even though she was still enjoying her first hours back in north america after her magnificent season, there was no celebration on the docket.  walking off into the night, shiffrin, probably as good in her sport as anyone else in theirs, planned a typically early bedtime. there are now new responsibilities: she was due in a tv studio at dawn.

       " \"during the 2017 united states open,  serena williams , holder of 23 grand slam titles, was fighting for her life. she had just given birth to alexis olympia ohanian jr. by cesarean section and faced life-threatening  complications  from a pulmonary embolism and blood clotting.  she would be bedridden for six weeks.   one year later, she is back on the u.s. open courts, attempting to tie margaret court’s record of 24 grand slam titles.   her return, which has included a run to the wimbledon final in july, should be surprising to exactly no one. williams has joined a league of simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary women, those who return to work after childbirth and quickly perform at a very high level. elite athletes just have a different kind of office environment awaiting them.   in 1960, two years after giving birth to her daughter, the sprinter  wilma rudolph  won three gold medals at the rome olympics.  sheryl swoopes  returned to the basketball court six weeks after giving birth to her son. she led the houston comets to the 1997 w.n.b.a. championship. the scottish golfer catriona matthew won the women’s british open in august 2009, 10 weeks after giving birth to her second daughter. the british heptathlete jessica ennis-hill gave birth to her first son in july 2014. she won gold at the world championships 13 months later.        because of a lack of scientific data, there are few studies on elite athletes who give birth and return to the highest levels of competition soon thereafter, said dr. miho tanaka\\u200b, director of the women’s sports medicine program at johns hopkins.             image     wilma rudolph, on her way to three gold medals at the 1960 olympics, as the mother of a toddler.   credit  associated press

katie and 11-week-old sophie, days after winning the women’s british open in 2009.   credit  jeff j mitchell/getty images        when it comes to following medical advice, these athletes must look toward individualized recommendations and their innate ability to be hyper-aware of their own bodies. whatever attributes allow elite athletes to get to their level of fitness and bounce back from injury with greater speed can surely help them return to sport after childbirth, tanaka said. “but what that mechanism is — whether that’s physical or mental, or both — that formula would be hard to translate.”   dr. cordelia carter, director of the women’s sports medicine center at n.y.u. langone health, said williams had an uncomplicated pregnancy but a very complicated postpartum period, and she continues to achieve above and beyond what many, rightly or wrongly, thought was possible. “so looking at her, we don’t yet know our limits, which is powerful,” she said.        it always has been.   kerri walsh jennings  volleyball    kerri walsh jennings  was five weeks pregnant during the 2012 london olympics. her third pregnancy was marked by her third gold medal game.   walsh jennings, who had always “looked forward to being a mommy and a working mommy,” recalled being discouraged from starting a family during her career. she was told it would negatively impact her performance and financial opportunities. “i didn’t find that to be the case,” walsh jennings, a five-time olympian, said.             image        kerri walsh jennings, in red, spiking while pregnant at the 2012 olympics.   credit  doug mills/the new york times         as a new mother, walsh jennings found herself in what she described as comical — and unexpected — situations. upon returning to training in manhattan beach, calif., in the months after giving birth, she heard a newborn cry. “i started leaking!” she said, laughing. “the body is incredible.”   in that first year back after having her second child, and just two years after having her first child, walsh jennings won a silver medal at the 2011 world championships. she won three grand slam events on the  fivb beach volleyball world tour  the same year.   “my team was me,” walsh jennings said of how she made her training decisions after becoming a mother. “the no. 1 guiding principle is listen to yourself, that if something feels wrong, don’t do it.”   now 40, she is looking to get to the 2020 olympics, in tokyo, with all three of her children on the sideline.         tirunesh dibaba  track and field  early in her career, the ethiopian distance runner tirunesh dibaba earned the nickname baby faced destroyer. in 2008, dibaba ran the 5,000-meter race in 14 minutes 11.15 seconds, a record that still stands. she also won the 10,000-meter race at the 2008 and 2012 olympics.  but she was not done.   “even before giving birth, i had decided that i would be back to training and back to racing,” dibaba said. she gave birth to her son in march 2015.             image        tirunesh dibaba celebrating her bronze medal in the 10,000 at the 2016 rio olympic games.    credit  jewel samad/agence france-presse

third  in the 10,000 meters at the 2016 rio olympics, earning her sixth olympic medal. the new mother had set a personal record with a time of 29:42.56, the fourth fastest 10,000-meter time ever run by a woman.   joy fawcett   soccer   the american soccer player joy fawcett was a pioneer for women on and off the soccer field. a three-time olympian, she was among the first united states soccer

1999, and 2003 women’s world cups, as well as the 1996 and the 2000 olympic games.         in 2001, the sports columnist george vecsey wrote that fawcett, at 33, was not missing anything but sleep. “she is not missing the experience of motherhood and she is not missing the thrill of playing in the first season of the women’s united soccer association,” he  wrote .   dara torres   swimming   dara torres  got back in the pool — competing — just three weeks after giving birth in 2006.   her doctor advised her to take six weeks off before doing aerobic exercise, but changed his mind upon seeing

alto, calif., for another swim meet two months later. her comeback (rather, her  second comeback ) had begun, and it landed her at the olympics.  “it wasn’t like i had this long process,” torres said of qualifying for the olympics after having a child. “i went to this meet, i did well, and all of a sudden, people wanted me to try, and that’s kind of how it happened.  “my attitude was, ‘why couldn’t a 41-year-old make an olympic team?’ ”   she went on to win three silver medals at the 2008 beijing olympics.         lisa anderson  surfing   lisa anderson  learned she was pregnant while competing in hawaii. then 23, she had just landed her first sponsor — no small thing for a female surfer in the early 1990s. she had dreams of becoming a world champion. “i was terrified,” she said. “what was going to happen to my career?”            image        lisa anderson, a four-time  world surfing champion, posed with her son, mason, in 2003.   credit  pierre tostee/getty images         she continued competing. it was five and a half months until competitors learned she was pregnant, when she forfeited a competition because of dangerous conditions. “i’m still going to compete,” she recalled saying. “i just can’t surf big waves.”  she gave birth to a daughter in august 1993 and was competing two weeks later. she finished the season seventh in the world. her drive to win was stronger than ever. “people were probably thinking i couldn’t do it, and it made me want to do it more.  “i just wanted to have everything, i wanted to show i could do it all,” she said. and she did — earning the title of world champion for the  next four seasons : 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997.   paula radcliffe   running   paula radcliffe  entered the 2007 new york city marathon as the world-record

       " 'washington — ashton locklear, a world champion gymnast who hopes to compete at the 2020 olympics, did not believe much of what u.s.a. gymnastics told lawmakers on tuesday at a senate hearing about keeping athletes safe from abuse.  u.s.a. gymnastics is sorry that dr. larry nassar abused so many gymnasts, said kerry perry, the organization’s president, in her testimony. u.s.a. gymnastics is athlete-centric now, she said. it is making it easier to report abuse.  to ms. locklear, it was just more spin.  “nothing has changed,” said ms. locklear, who spoke publicly for the first time in an interview tuesday about being sexually abused by dr. nassar as well as experiencing emotional and physical abuse by her longtime coach. she is one of just two known dr. nassar victims still competing on the united states women’s national team. simone biles is the other.  “the same culture in the sport exists,” ms. locklear said. “athletes are still afraid to speak out. the same mind-set exists, and i know that personally.”        more than 80 victims of dr. nassar, the former national team doctor, attended the hearing, including 11-year-old mimi wegener. she is a gymnast from michigan and was 8 when nassar began abusing her. she had advice for u.s.a. gymnastics, the united states olympic committee and michigan state, where dr. nassar worked.  “i feel like they could do a better job,” mimi said in an interview after a news conference during which she wiped away tears. “i want to help make sure it doesn’t happen to another kid.”  the goal of these senate hearings, lawmakers said, is to ensure that the abuse doesn’t happen to other kids. they grilled ms. perry; john engler, the interim president of michigan state; and other olympic officials about flaws and loopholes in the system to safeguard athletes. they pointed out that two gymnastics coaches who had been suspended by u.s.a. gymnastics  were still coaching in california .            image     ashton locklear, far left, looked on as senator jerry moran of kansas, center left, and senator richard blumenthal spoke at a news conference in washington on tuesday.   credit  gabriella demczuk for the new york times         they chastised u.s.a. gymnastics and the u.s.o.c. for trying in court filings to deny responsibility for dr. nassar’s abuse and, in turn, for the damage he caused the athletes. they asked how parents and congress could trust organizations that don’t even concede that dr. nassar worked for them.        “there’s a moral responsibility here,” said senator richard blumenthal, democrat of connecticut.  ms. perry agreed that u.s.a. gymnastics has a moral obligation, but ms. locklear and other survivors said they did not believe the organization was living up to that obligation. athlete victims do not feel supported in their relationships with olympic sports organizations and universities, according aly raisman, the olympic champion and outspoken nassar survivor who attended the hearing.  ms. locklear, 20, an alternate on the 2016 olympic team, said athletes are still at risk for sexual, emotional and nonphysical abuse in the sport, despite u.s.a. gymnastics’ characterization to lawmakers that the sport is improving its protection of athletes. she said she left north carolina and her longtime coach, qi han, earlier this year to train in texas because of what she characterized as emotional and physical abuse. she said she told u.s.a. gymnastics and the u.s. center for safesport, which investigates abuse in olympic sports, about the abuse in 2017.  “they know about his abuse and they did nothing,” she said.  u.s.a. gymnastics officials were not available for comment. a spokesman for safesport said it does not comment on individual matters.  when reached by phone on tuesday, mr. han vehemently denied mistreating ms. locklear. he said he was shocked by her accusations, which included yelling, randomly telling her to leave his gym, and throwing a cellphone at her.  “i don’t know where this is coming from,” mr. han said. “i never did any of those things to her or said any of those things to her. ashton was my gymnast and my job was to protect her.”  ms. locklear said mr. han’s treatment of her and dr. nassar’s abuse had pushed her into depression and that she had even had fleeting thoughts of killing herself. her mother, carrie, who worked at the gym, said she sensed her daughter was struggling in 2014, around the time dr. nassar first abused her. they discussed the possibility of changing gyms after ashton locklear complained to her mother about mr. han’s treatment. carrie locklear said the family could not afford to make a move.  ashton locklear said mr. han would scream at her during workouts and throw her out of the gym, saying things like, “your face tells me that you don’t want to be here.” she described having to follow him around the gym for hours, weeping and begging him to take her back. that would only make him angrier, she said.        he once threw his cellphone at her and hit her leg, she said. during meals, she said he would hover over her to tell her what, exactly, she should eat, she said.            image        mimi wegener, 11, was hugged on capitol hill by sarah klein. both were victims of dr. larry nassar.   credit  gabriella demczuk for the new york times         “he would constantly say i was stupid and that he would tell martha that i was bad and she would hold it against me,” ms. locklear said, referring to martha karolyi, the former national team coordinator. “i had to walk on eggshells. this is why athletes are afraid to come forward. coaches have this power over their athletes that keeps the athletes scared and silent. i still feel like i’m terrified.”  ms. locklear said that when she told mr. han that dr. nassar made her feel uncomfortable, he put up his hand to stop her.  “‘you should never be disrespectful about someone who is trying to help you,’” she recalled mr. han saying. “‘you should be thankful because you don’t even deserve any of this.’”  mr. han denied saying that and his lawyer, melissa owen, said mr. han’s gym was vigilant about encouraging athletes to speak out about abuse, especially after dr. nassar’s abuse became public in 2016.  mr. locklear said it was only late last year when she realized that dr. nassar had abused her because she had thought his treatments were legal and medically necessary. she decided to speak publicly so she could help make gymnastics a safer place for younger athletes. she said that unless the cutthroat culture at local gyms that instills fear in young gymnasts subsides, the athletes would remain vulnerable to all types of mistreatment.        ms. raisman, who has made similar arguments, tried to talk to  sarah hirshland , who is taking over as the u.s.o.c.’s new chief executive, after the hearing ended, but ms. hirshland rushed out of the hearing room.  according to ms. raisman, ms. hirshland said, “i’ve been instructed i can’t talk to you.”  ms. raisman responded: “you can’t just say ‘hi’ to me?”  ms. hirshland, who will become chief executive in late august, said no.  later, though, ms. hirshland sent an apology email to ms. raisman, according to a u.s.o.c. spokeswoman.  it was all a misunderstanding, the email said, and she was sorry.

       " 'harrison, n.j. — two years after they began a public fight for equal pay, and a year after they signed a new collective bargaining agreement, members of the united states women’s soccer team have emerged as a new kind of role model, and a surprisingly valuable resource, for women’s teams from around the world.  canada’s soccer team asked for advice on how to get maternity coverage into contracts. w.n.b.a. players did the same when they had questions about how best to press their owners for leaguewide standards on issues like hotels, travel and trainers. and last fall, a player from the united states women’s hockey team reached out.  only months before the pyeongchang olympics, the player said, u.s.a. hockey was still dragging its feet about marketing promises that had been made when the players used strike threats to win a major pay increase in march 2017. the team, a gold medal contender, still didn’t even have its own social media accounts. could the soccer team’s union recommend a marketing consultant who could do what the hockey federation apparently would not?  “i think right now there’s really a women’s coming-together movement, and it’s happening in sport and outside of sport,” united states midfielder christen press said. “and i think people all around the world are realizing how important it is to make these connections with people on the same journey as you.”        so when the american soccer players embraced the american hockey players on the sideline before playing a 1-1 tie against france at red bull arena — the reigning women’s world cup champions meeting the newly crowned olympic gold medalists — the hugs seemed more genuine, more heartfelt,  more personal  than usual.          the outreach from other athletes and teams comes in many forms, players from both teams said. it can arrive as text messages between friends or teammates from different countries, or in calls to the union itself. the soccer players can back another team’s fight, or trumpet its victories, with a blast from their well-followed social media accounts.  but little by little, other female athletes around the world have started finding their voices, too.  spain’s national team rose up to  demand  the ouster of its coach after the last world cup, and several prominent members of brazil’s squad  quit their team last year to protest  the ouster of a popular female coach in favor of a man. nigeria’s players held  a sit-in at their hotel  to demand unpaid salaries and bonuses after winning the african championship. ireland’s team  threatened to strike . australia’s did. and in october, norway’s players demanded — and won — equal pay with their men’s counterparts.        “this really feels like a tipping point,” said the espn commentator julie foudy, a veteran of similar gender-equity fights a generation ago after she won a women’s world cup.  foudy praised the union’s new executive director, becca roux, for empowering the united states players to do much of the hard work themselves, both as they negotiated an improved collective bargaining agreement and in the months since it was signed. most members of the team serve on one union subcommittee or another, and they hold elections to pick representatives. regular meetings are held with u.s. soccer to ensure promises are being kept.  “i think that’s probably the most gratifying part of it,” foudy said of the women’s team’s growth as an off-field force for its own interests. “it’s that they realized and started to pay more attention to: what’s going on? where do we want to take this? where do we want the league to go? that’s a hugely healthy exercise.”  their progress has not been lost on other teams, which have used the soccer team as a sounding board for their own fights. last spring, the hockey players were among the most prominent teams to reach out — before, after, and during their battle with u.s.a. hockey for improved pay and working conditions. the hockey players went further than their soccer counterparts — they threatened to  boycott the world championships  if they did not get their demands met — and they eventually prevailed.              image     the united states women’s olympic hockey team was honored during halftime of sunday’s game. before winning gold at the pyeonchang olympics, members of the hockey team reached out to the women’s national soccer team for advice on how to pursue a better marketing strategy.   credit  elsa/getty images         “it’s always great when women support women,” the three-time hockey olympian gigi marvin said. “but i think just as people you support one another, you support what’s right. you support what’s just and fair.”        “i’m not going to reap the benefits of what we were able to accomplish,” she added, “but my little niece is going to. my cousins playing peewee tournaments will.”  for all the teams, though, their own careers and championship ambitions remain the priority. sunday’s soccer game was yet another chance for a swelling group of national team players to catch the eye of coach jill ellis as she looks ahead to the 2019 women’s world cup in france.  ellis has called 58 players into national team training camps since the end of the 2016 rio olympics, including 27 who were invited for the first time. sunday’s starting lineup included not only beloved regulars like megan rapinoe, alex morgan and mallory pugh, but also the 19-year-old stanford defender tierna davidson and the 22-year-old midfielder andi sullivan, the top pick in this year’s national women’s soccer league draft.  the big plays still come from the most familiar faces — the americans’ goal began with kelley o’hara winning a foul and rapinoe whipping in a free kick before pugh slammed in a rebound — but tests like france on sunday, germany last week and england on wednesday in orlando, fla., are good for everyone.  “we get tested, we get vetted, we get to feel the ebb and flow of being up and being down,” ellis said. “that’s why we bring these teams in, to experience that.”  off the field, the work continues, too. the national team recently chose o’hara to join press and becky sauerbrunn as part of its three-member executive committee, and rapinoe and meghan klingenberg have taken leading roles as the team continues to pursue new streams of licensing revenue outside u.s. soccer through a group marketing firm it created with the unions representing n.f.l. and w.n.b.a. players.  but they all know the calls and messages from other athletes, on other national teams, and even in other sports, will continue. and they know many of them have much further to go.        ireland’s women’s soccer team threatened to skip games last year because, among other things, the players were tired of sharing track suits with the country’s age-group national teams. and in september, an argentine player revealed that she and her national teammates were paid as little as 150 pesos ( about $8.50 ) for each training session.  “a lot of the work you do for our union, it’s for ourselves,” press said. “but there’s always the contextualization of hoping that when you’re standing up for yourself, you’re setting a good example.  “you want to think that they’re inspired by us, we’re inspired by them, and that makes us all more powerful.”       ',\n",
       " 'pyeongchang, south korea — at an olympics marked by a lackluster medal performance, the american team had been waiting for a flash of dominance, a sign that something actually was going as a lot of people back home wanted and expected it to.  high hopes for a sweep of the podium rode into the freestyle skiing halfpipe, with  david wise , who won the gold medal when the event made its debut at the 2014 sochi games, and aaron blunck, the reigning world champion, among four americans in the final field of 12.  in the end, the americans delivered, not a sweep, but a gold and silver dominating performance as new zealand, in the form of 16-year-old, took third.  wise, 27, of reno, nev., defended his gold from the 2014 sochi games, while alex ferreira, 23, of aspen, colo., won silver and nico porteous, bronze.        the breathtaking acrobatics and one-two finish drew a sustained roar from an american-heavy crowd at the phoenix snow park.            image     the american alex ferreira on the way to winning silver.   credit  dylan martinez/reuters         those fans clearly hoped to see a sweep, with such a high caliber of american athletes in the field. but this is halfpipe, where it is common for the mighty to literally fall (as blunck, 21, of crested butte, colo., did in his second run, and wise did in his first two runs only to recover with a jaw-dropping final go that bested the others.)  wise chalked that up to the nature of the sport, in which each run can demand more awe as skiers execute complicated spins and switchbacks in an effort to top one another’s tricks.  he acknowledged that there was a lot of hype heading into the event, but the team sought to keep it out of their heads on their runs.        “sharing the top two steps of that podium with alex is amazing,” he said. “the reality is the other guys had the opportunity. aaron blunck had the opportunity.  torin yater-wallace  had the opportunity to take that spot away from nico, and they didn’t do it. so i’m excited for skiing to look as good as it did today.”  their 1-2 finish certainly gave a jolt to the united states’ medal count, which through thursday’s events stood at 21 medals over all and eight gold. with just a few days left of competition, the americans seemed on pace to lag behind sochi’s disappointing total of 28 medals, nine of them gold.  still, five of the united states’ eight golds have come in halfpipe or slopestyle events. in total, snowboard and freestyle skiing accounts for 10 of the united states’ 21 medals.  “halfpipe really caters to creativity,” wise said. “it caters to doing things sort of differently than anybody else does. i think as americans we have rebel in our blood.”  wise used three different pairs of skis because he had binding problems on the first two runs, leading to wipeouts. he scored 17 on the first and 6.4 on the second before performing a near-perfect run on the third for a 97.20. he landed double corks in all four directions: front left, front right, switch backward left and switch right, which basically means he spun ridiculously high and twirled in nerve-racking succession off the halfpipe banks as if he were on a frosty trampoline.  ferreira had a 96.4, and porteous a 94.8 after trying a succession of moves he said he had never done before.        “because you’re at the olympics, you just go for it,” porteous said.  he took note of the american skiers and the hype about them completely dominating the event.  “it would have been cool to see the u.s.a. sweep, but i’m a really proud kiwi right now,” he said.  yater-wallace, who overcame  a hard-luck string of injury and illness  to make the team, finished ninth, with a score no higher than a 65.2.  “it was a fight; it’s always a fight,” he said.  wise said he drew strength from watching other skiers’ runs.  “it gave me a little bit of a boost,” he said. “i was able to to say, hey, alex has already crushed it. torin has already crushed it. aaron blunck has already done an amazing run. nico, coming out of the gate and landing something he has never done before. freeski won.”       ',\n",
       " 'newark — before the metropolitan riveters’ first-ever home game, in october 2015, their opponents’ bus was late. as fans became antsy and players became increasingly confused, forward janine weber entertained both audiences by juggling oranges.  the boston pride finally arrived and, with less bonhomie, shellacked the riveters, 7-1.  it was an inauspicious start, one that made it hard to envision the riveters as a future championship contender. they went on to finish the national women’s hockey league’s inaugural season with a record of 4-12-2.  two seasons later, guided by the original members kiira dosdall, ashley johnston, bray ketchum and madison packer, the riveters, coached by chad wiseman, had the best record in the n.w.h.l. (13-3). on sunday, they hosted the defending champion buffalo beauts in the isobel cup final in front of a sold-out crowd at the barnabas health hockey house.        alexa gruschow sent a shot past beauts goaltender amanda leveille 5 minutes 33 seconds into the first period and katie fitzgerald sealed the shutout, making 28 saves, as the riveters won, 1-0, capturing their first n.w.h.l. title.          “if you would have asked any of the returning players after the first day of practice in brooklyn if we’d be standing here with a trophy three years later, they probably would have told you you were crazy,” packer said. “it just shows how far chad has brought the team, how much the league has grown and developed.”  in many ways the riveters’ maturation parallels that of the n.w.h.l., which in 2015 became the first professional women’s league in north america to offer salaries.  late buses are no longer a concern, nor are other mishaps like choppy online broadcasts — sunday’s game was live-streamed on twitter, part of a deal the league reached with the social media company  last june .  “the first year there were so many unintended hiccups, we just kind of got used to them,” dosdall said last week. “but you could definitely compare our growth as an organization to that of the league.”        aside from cosmetic improvements, the four remaining original riveters noted how the overall operation of the league had progressed. this year, the riveters and beauts got financial backing from the n.h.l.’s  devils  and  sabres .            image     alexa gruschow, rear, went airborne to score the riveters’ lone goal of the final on sunday.   credit  matthew raney         utilizing barnabas health hockey house, the devils’ practice facility, gives riveters players amenities, like their own locker room and access to ice time, that weren’t always available when they were based out of aviator sports and events center at floyd bennett field in brooklyn during the 2015-16 season.  johnston, who commutes from the albany area for riveters practices and games, joked that driving toward the rockaways took 10 years off her life (it did, actually eat away at the life span of her car — johnston’s engine died before this season, forcing her to replace it).  ketchum was pleased to see conditions in the league pointing upward, particularly after the n.w.h.l.  cut salaries  in the middle of last season. the improvements have included a more active role by the league’s players’ association and better communication with the league’s commissioner, dani rylan.  “there’s a lot more transparency between dani and her staff and her players,” ketchum said. “after that pay cut last year, we really wanted to see that. that was the most important thing.”  at one point during the off-season, three of the four original veterans had decided they were going to retire. but as ketchum, dosdall and packer began discussing their competitive void, the band got back together.        “we all talked at different points and kind of came to the same conclusion at the same time that we were going to do it and come back,” johnston said. “like a domino effect.”  in addition to the original four players, the riveters are the only team to have employed the same head coach and athletic trainer — ashley robbins — since their first game. all of the riveters’ core four credited wiseman with creating a rigid culture that brought them to the apex of the league, even when they may not always have had the most talented roster.  but wiseman, who often commutes from his home in canada to new jersey to coach the team, credited much of the riveters’ ascent to the four originals, as do their teammates.  “i think we’re definitely lucky,” said fitzgerald, who was named the final’s most valuable player. “a lot of them considered retiring after last season but i’m glad they didn’t. our team wouldn’t be what it is.”  slap shots  the markham thunder earned their first canadian women’s hockey league championship, defeating kunlun red star, 2-1, in overtime on sunday to win the clarkson cup final at ricoh coliseum in toronto.  laura stacey , who earned a silver medal with canada last month at the 2018 winter olympics and returned to the thunder two weeks ago, scored the winner.

       " 'gilroy, calif. — daniel cormier, the ultimate fighting championship light-heavyweight champion, is built stocky, like a gallon jug of milk. he’s always been built a little like a gallon jug of milk. a shade under 6 feet tall, with a receding hairline, a round belly, white streaks encroaching on his dark beard and a wide, toothy grin as he steps around unopened wedding gifts in his man cave — it’s hard to imagine that this 38-year-old father of two young children is one of the best in the history of mixed martial arts, and is preparing for the pinnacle of a lifetime in combat.  dozens of photographs, trophies, plaques and medals cover the walls, cataloging his nearly 20 years in wrestling and his more recent ascension to the peak of mixed martial arts.  yet one wall in the man cave stands apart from the rest. on it, there’s a poster, and six photos, all from the night of jan. 3, 2015. that is when he challenged jon jones, his most hated rival, for the u.f.c. light-heavyweight title. it was a battle, in his mind, of good and evil. but it was also the culmination of a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice in combat, and of years of unimaginable heartbreak and misfortune, from the loss of his infant daughter to the death of his olympic dreams.  in three photos, cormier is punching jones in the face; in two of them, cormier is lifting jones in the air above his head; in one, his right foot is connecting with jones’s jaw. the photos and the belts across the room tell a story of what happened that night. but they don’t tell the true story: cormier lost. and afterward, cormier cried.        “listen,” cormier says, his mood darkening as he regards the wall tableau. “i think jon jones cheated me the first time.”  fighting is simple: to be the champion, you have to beat the champion. cormier did not beat jones. everything about cormier — the way he carries himself, the way athletes at the highest levels of their sports regard him, the success he has had — says that he is a winner. but he is not the best, not without defeating jones.  that could change saturday night in anaheim, calif., when they face each other again in what might be the sport’s most important fight in years, or at least a more legitimate one than the spectacle that will be the matchup in august between the best boxer in the world, floyd mayweather, and one of the mixed martial arts world’s biggest stars, conor mcgregor.            image     cormier takes a break from sparring to talk to his coach, javier mendez. &ldquo;his legacy now is one of the greats who couldn&rsquo;t beat the great,&rdquo; mendez says.    credit  josh haner/the new york times         ever since cormier first captured the u.f.c. belt, jones’s presence has loomed large. it is a fog that seeps into every cormier achievement. cormier is seen by many fans and by jones as an illegitimate champion. cormier’s obsession with jones indicates that, at least on some level, he feels the same. his coach, javier mendez, thinks about it, too.        “his legacy now is one of the greats who couldn’t beat the great,” mendez says. “he couldn’t beat the great one. that’s what it will be.”  one blow after another  cormier’s story began in lafayette, la., in 1979. he grew up poor with his mother, stepfather and three siblings. he doesn’t remember much of his father, joseph. that’s because, on thanksgiving day 1986, when cormier was 7, joseph cormier was shot dead by a family member. it was the first in a long line of hardships in daniel cormier’s life.  when he was a junior in high school, a good friend was killed in a car accident. when he was a high school senior, his cousin died in one, too. on jan. 27, 2001, when he was a senior at oklahoma state university, his close friend and roommate, dan lawson, perished in a plane crash that claimed 10 members of the university’s basketball team.  on march 6, 2003, cormier and an ex-girlfriend, carolyn flowers, gave birth to his first child, kaedyn imri cormier. three months later, kaedyn died in a car accident while traveling with friends.  on her gravestone, near the bottom, it reads:   in kaedyn’s honor    2003 pan am. champ    2003 world championship 5th place   through it all, cormier had wrestling. when he was 10, a youth wrestling coach invited cormier and a cousin to his team’s practice after happening upon the two scrapping in the street. cormier spent his first practice getting ground into the mat but returned the next day.            image        cormier wrestling in the 2004 summer olympics in athens against alireza heidari of iran.   credit  robert laberge/getty images         he dedicated his life to the sport, but was never the best in the world. he finished fifth at the 2003 world championships. in 2004, he competed in the olympics in athens, but left empty-handed after losing in the semifinals and the bronze medal match.        in 2008, he was chosen captain of the olympic wrestling team in beijing. cormier had finished third in the 2007 world championships. he was expected to leave china with a medal, maybe even gold. then, disaster.  cormier used to walk around at 235 pounds, then drop to 211.5 pounds at weigh-ins solely by dehydrating. at the 2008 olympics, he made weight, then began rehydrating. usually, the process was easy: he would weigh in, and while rehydrating, he would get cramps, then vomit and relieve himself. and then he would be fine. but this time, he got too heavy, and had to cut too much weight too fast. while he was vomiting, the cramps were more painful than he had experienced before.  then, his legs stopped working.  his kidneys were failing. he was rushed to a nearby hospital, held overnight and pulled from competition.  “it feels like death,” cormier says now. “i literally thought i was dying.”  he never competed in wrestling again.  “i let my team down. i let u.s.a. wrestling, my coaches — all the people who had put so much time and energy into actually getting me there, to not compete?” cormier says. “i let my country down.”  this is the story cormier tells when asked why he turned to mixed martial arts: he resigned in something like disgrace, and he was fighting for something like redemption. but there’s another, simpler version of events, too.  “i was lost without competition,” cormier says. “i was a lost man.”  back in 2002, cormier received a call from a man named dewayne zinkin. zinkin had founded a sports management company the year before with his partner, bob cook. zinkin thought cormier was a great prospect for a new sport: mixed martial arts.        “after you’re done,” zinkin said to the wrestler, “call me.”  fighting is a sport littered with retired wrestlers lost without competition. cormier was no different from them. in 2009, broke, fat and depressed, he picked up the phone.  against a behemoth  cormier rocketed through the m.m.a. ranks. he garnered the nickname “king of the grind,” never lost a round and soon was one of the best heavyweight fighters in the world. so was his training partner, cain velasquez. fans clamored for the two to fight, but cormier and velasquez had grown as close as brothers.  “they’d never fight each other,” mendez says. “that bond they have is unique.”  six years after the weight cut ended his wrestling career, cormier dropped to 205 pounds, to the light heavyweight division, placing him directly in the path of jon jones, who had also surged to the top and cemented himself as one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time.  m.m.a. has all kinds of fighters but jones is different.            image        cormier lifting jones during their fight in las vegas in 2015.   credit  steve marcus/getty images         he is 6 feet 4, with a 7-foot wingspan, and his long arms and legs allow him to dole out punishment from across the cage and lock in chokes and submissions from anywhere. in a sport as brutal as fighting, he is more violent, and more creative in his violence, than anyone else. his only loss was a disqualification. he conducts a terrifying symphony of kicks, punches, spinning elbows and body slams that leave some of the best fighters bloody, helpless, or both.  “jones beat eight guys in a row, and i think five of them were u.f.c. champions. it’s ridiculous. like, seriously!” cormier says, unable to hide his admiration. he starts listing the defeated on his fingers. “shogun, and rashad and rampage,” he says. “and me.”  on jan. 3, 2015, after a lead-up that included a stage-clearing brawl and vulgar back-and-forth caught on camera after a joint espn interview, the two finally fought. jones won.        it wasn’t just that jones beat cormier, but how. going into the fight, the olympian had never been taken down. less than a minute into the match, jones caught a cormier kick, tripped him, and sent him crashing to the mat.  jones was huge, unbelievably strong and tireless. he outwrestled the olympic wrestler.  “i outgrinded him,” jones said in an interview after the fight.  “i don’t like daniel cormier. i don’t respect daniel cormier,” he continued. “i hope he’s somewhere crying right now. i’m sure he is.”  cormier was. he broke down walking back to the locker room, and wept in the arms of velasquez. many believe cormier just couldn’t handle losing. but he says that’s not why he wept.            image        dana white of the u.f.c. standing between cormier, left, and jones at a news conference last year.   credit  john locher/associated press         cormier says the jones fight was a repeat of the 2008 olympics. he should have done better, but he let his team, and himself, down, and facing them after the fight was too much to bear. for cormier, this is easier to stomach than the alternative: that he simply lost to the better man; that fighting in the same class at the same time as the greatest fighter of all time is something like a tragedy, outside his control.  then, on april 25, 2015, jones was arrested in albuquerque in a hit-and-run and charged with leaving the scene of an accident. the u.f.c. stripped him of his belt, and cormier beat anthony johnson, who had been designated no. 1, a month later to become the u.f.c. light-heavyweight champion.        jones was later reinstated. a rematch with cormier was scheduled for july 9, 2016. but two days before, jones was pulled from the fight. a drug test administered by the united states anti-doping agency, or usada, turned up two estrogen blockers, which are commonly used when athletes are cycling off steroids. he was suspended for a year.  jones pleaded ignorance, citing over-the-counter male-enhancement pills. usada concurred but kept the suspension in place.  “on the evidence before the panel,” it wrote in a statement, “the applicant is not a drug cheat.”  cormier doesn’t believe it.  “no one has really been able to keep that pace that i set, ever,” cormier says. “and i know from people in his gym: i know i’m outworking him. i know i’m doing more. i know i’m training harder. i know i’m living better. and i’m like, ‘how did he do that?’ it just can’t be the age difference.” (jones is 30.)            image        mixed martial arts filled a void for cormier after he stopped wrestling in 2008. “i was lost without competition,” he says. “i was a lost man.”   credit  photographs by josh haner/the new york times         writing an ending  a few years ago, cormier says, his family was on welfare. now he’s a millionaire. two and a half years ago, he, his wife, and his two children moved into a big house at the end of a cul-de-sac in gilroy, near san jose. during training camp, a friend from oklahoma state drove four hours to san jose to drop off a new pickup cormier had purchased: an all-black, custom ford raptor, not all that different from a raptor jones used to have.        cormier has a second career in place as an analyst on fox sports 1.  fox provides the suits he finds waiting for him in his dressing room. he doesn’t even own dress socks.            image        cormier with marquita, his 5-year-old daughter, in his home in gilroy, calif.   credit  josh haner/the new york times         the dream, he says, is to cross over into football and basketball. maybe get a debate show, and be the next shannon sharpe or stephen a. smith. but he’s not done yet.  cormier’s a better fighter than anyone jones has ever fought, and so part of what constitutes jones being the greatest fighter ever is his win over cormier, whose only loss is to jones. the two complete each other: both fighters’ paths to redemption run through the other; both see each other as a fraud.  on may 12, jones and cormier were both on hand for u.f.c.’s summer kickoff news conference. they had to be pulled apart. cormier commented on jones’s haircut; jones asked how cormier would explain to his children that he wasn’t a real champion; cormier responded by throwing a water bottle, hitting jones.  once settled, jones asserted that cormier was a paper champion.  “he never beat me,” jones said. “he never beat me.”  cormier questioned whether jones would even show up to the rematch. “is this guy going to mess this up again by doing steroids, or snorting cocaine, or sandblasting prostitutes? what’s this guy going to do to mess this up this time?”  “prostitutes?” jones responded. “i beat you after a weekend of cocaine.” (jones briefly checked into a drug-treatment center shortly after he first beat cormier.)        cormier tells himself that a lifetime of training harder and living better, will eventually pay off in ultimate glory. because if jones beats him again, what was the point of cormier’s pain and sacrifice? what’s the point of any of this?            image        cormier working out in san jose, calif. he has a second career in place as an analyst for fox sports 1.   credit  josh haner/the new york times         he believes he will beat jones on saturday night, and from there, his path is clear.  “you beat him again, and you walk away,” cormier says. “in combat sports, most people don’t get that opportunity. it’s in my grasp.”  but if cormier loses, there won’t be a third fight. he will never get a shot at jones again.  trapped between his nemesis and his brother, cormier’s final chapter would read something like a tragedy.

       " 'irena szewinska , a sprinter and long jumper who won seven medals in five olympic games, tying an olympic women’s record and becoming a national hero in poland, died on friday at a hospital in warsaw. she was 72.  the cause was cancer, said henryk urbas, the press spokesman for the polish olympic committee.  szewinska’s athletic accomplishments and long run of olympic appearances led many to consider her one of the greatest polish athletes of the 20th century. in a  tribute on twitter , president andrzej duda of poland called her “the first lady of polish sport,” and prime minister  mateusz morawiecki  called her “an inspiration for generations of polish athletes.”  a versatile, indefatigable athlete, szewinska set multiple world records; at one point she had the fastest times in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints. she stood a reedy 5 feet 9 inches tall and had a devastating kick, or last burst of speed, that sometimes let her snatch victory by a stride.  szewinska (pronounced sha-veen-ska) competed in her first olympic games in tokyo in 1964, when she was 18. she won silver medals in the 200-meter race and the long jump and a gold in the 400-meter relay.        in later olympics she won two more gold medals, in the 200-meter race at the mexico city games in 1968 and the 400-meter in montreal in 1976; and two bronzes, in the 100-meter in 1968 and the 200-meter at the munich games in 1972.  the only woman to win seven olympic medals for track and field events before szewinska was the australian runner and hurdler  shirley strickland , who won her medals in three games beginning in 1948.  the 400-meter finals in montreal in 1976 was one of szewinska’s most dramatic races. in the months before, she and the east german sprinter christina brehmer had both broken the world record for the 400-meter race, and now they were meeting in montreal.  szewinska pulled ahead in the last seconds of the race to beat brehmer by several meters for the gold medal. she had also set a new world record, 49.28 seconds — one that held until 1978, when the east german runner marita koch broke it.              image     szewinska at the international association of athletics federations indoor world championships in sopot, poland, in 2014. she was inducted into the association&rsquo;s hall of fame in 2012.   credit  alik keplicz/associated press         szewinska’s next, and last, olympics were not as exciting. she pulled a muscle at the 1980 games in moscow and retired soon after.  irena kirszenstein was born on may 24, 1946, to jakub and eugenia (rafalska) kirszenstein in what was then leningrad, russia. after the end of world war ii the family returned to poland and lived in warsaw, where a teacher first discovered her swiftness at a school competition.  in 1967 she married janusz szewinski, a hurdler and coach who later became a sports photographer. she earned a degree in economics from the university of warsaw in 1970.  in addition to her husband, with whom she lived in lomianki, outside warsaw, her survivors include two sons, andrzej and jaroslaw, and four grandchildren.  after her competitive career ended, szewinska worked for different athletic bodies and became an advocate for female athletes. over the course of her career she was a member of the international olympic committee and the international association of athletics federations’ women’s committee as well as the president of the polish women’s sport association.  szewinska’s olympic medals and world records were not her only honors. she was a five-time gold medalist at the european athletics championships and won more than two dozen times at the polish championships.  she was inducted into the international jewish sports hall of fame in 1981 and the international association of athletics federations’ hall of fame in 2012. four years later she received the order of the white eagle, poland’s highest award.

       " 'santa clara, calif. — in the pool, katie ledecky, a five-time olympic champion, was churning through a 1,500-meter freestyle race. in the stands, chris olmstead was craning her neck to see.  olmstead was not another casual fan drawn to the george f. haines international swim center to watch ledecky compete here in her last tuneup before the usa swimming nationals this week in indianapolis, where the team for next month’s world championships in budapest is being chosen.  in her lap, olmstead clutched a sheet of paper containing race splits from when ledecky set the world record in 2015. as the race unfurled, olmstead alternated between studying the times on the paper and ledecky’s stroke.        when ledecky touched more than 50 meters ahead of her nearest rival, olmstead stood, clapped and cheered with maternal affection. “that a way, katie!” she exclaimed. then, turning to her husband, she added, in the parlance of a distance swimmer: “she split a great race. but i think it hurt.”            image     left, chris olmstead, then known as von saltza, at santa clara high school, circa 1960. right, katie ledecky before she won the women’s 200-meter freestyle at the rio olympics.   credit  left, getty images; chang w. lee/the new york times         ledecky, 20, and olmstead, 73, are not technically related, but they are both swimming blue bloods. few people can relate to the shared experience of teenage stardom that bonds them.  olmstead, the first american woman to break five minutes in the 400-meter freestyle, looks at ledecky, the first american woman to break four minutes, and it is like seeing an old home movie that has been colorized and digitized.  “i identify with her,” said olmstead, who held four world records and 32 american records. at just 14 years old, she was described in a 1958 sports illustrated cover story as “the best freestyle swimmer ever developed in america.”  the distinction once held by olmstead has been passed down like a royal title to ledecky, who has set 13 world records in the 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyles and is the reigning world and olympic champion in the 200 meters. in indianapolis this week, ledecky extended her range to include the 100-meter freestyle, in which she finished sixth.        “there is a vicarious aspect to my relationship with katie,” olmstead said. “it takes me back to all the exciting and memorable aspects of my swimming life.”            image        katie ledecky, front, competing in the pro swim series at the santa clara swim club on june 1. she holds the world record for the women&rsquo;s 1,500-meter freestyle.   credit  preston gannaway for the new york times         like ledecky, a five-time medalist in the 2016 rio games, olmstead emerged from the 1960 summer olympics in rome as the outstanding female teenage swimmer, with four medals, including three golds. only two freestyle events were on the women’s program, and olmstead, then competing under her maiden name, von saltza, raced in both.  she placed second in the 100 freestyle to the australian superstar dawn fraser and won the 400 freestyle with a time more than 10 seconds better than the next-fastest american. olmstead also won gold in the 4 x 100 medley and 4 x 100 freestyle relays. she would have been a gold-medal contender in the 200 freestyle and 200 backstroke, but her range was constrained by the limitations of the women’s olympic schedule, which did not include the races and consisted of only five individual events and two relays.  like ledecky, olmstead attended college at stanford. but when she enrolled in fall 1961, the university was still more than a decade from fielding its first competitive women’s swim team. women were not even allowed in the pool where the men’s team held its meets.  cut off from the sport she loved, olmstead retired from swimming and got on with her education and the rest of her life. her husband of 48 years, whom she met at stanford, said she rarely talked about her athletic feats. when it came time for the couple’s two children, both sons, to learn how to swim, olmstead enlisted someone else to teach them.  “after i stopped swimming, i didn’t want to be known as a swimmer,” olmstead said. “it was like, ‘o.k., i was an olympic champion, i did that, time to transition to something else.’”            image        left, the united states team, including olmstead, after winning the 4 x 100-meter freestyle relay at the 1960 olympics in rome. right, the united states team, including ledecky, celebrating its victory in the 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay at the 2016 rio olympics.   credit  left, associated press; right, jeffrey furticella/the new york times         she found an outlet for her competitiveness at ibm, which hired her as a systems engineer even though she possessed an undergraduate degree in asian history and only a rudimentary knowledge of computers. women were just breaking into the business ranks, and, olmstead said, the company recruiters viewed her olympic success as proof that she possessed the intangibles to succeed in ibm’s intense culture.  olmstead spent three decades collecting awards and accolades at ibm in a competitive environment that fed her need to achieve.  then came ledecky, who was the key that unlocked the trove of girlhood memories that olmstead had packed away. when ledecky won the 800-meter freestyle at the 2012 olympics in her international debut, olmstead said, “there was a connection there that i felt.”  at 5 feet 10 inches, olmstead had the same strong build and powerful stroke as the 6-foot ledecky. she also possessed the same reserved personality that turned her into a competitive fireball when mixed with chlorine. the headline of a sports illustrated article trumpeted olmstead’s essence in her own words: “i like to beat ’em.”  after following ledecky’s progress from afar for three years, olmstead reached out by email in the lead-up to the rio olympics. she wrote that she was impressed with ledecky’s dominance in the water and her humility out of it. olmstead expressed excitement that ledecky, a bethesda, md., native, was headed to her alma mater after the olympics.            image        near left, olmstead, the olympic runner-up in the 100-meter freestyle, on the medals podium in rome in 1960. right, ledecky won the women&rsquo;s 400-meter freestyle at the 2016 olympics.   credit  associated press; doug mills/the new york times         ledecky wrote back, and the pair have not stopped communicating. as ledecky learned more about olmstead’s swimming career, she gained a deeper appreciation for her own career trajectory. that olmstead did not have an opportunity to compete in college reminded ledecky how fortunate she was to have had the chance to compete in multiple olympics and the choice to swim in college or turn professional.  “i think a lot of people take for granted how lucky we are now to have college sports for women and to have the opportunities that we do,” she said.  their friendship also helped ease ledecky’s transition during her first year away from home, as she settled into life on the opposite coast from where she was born and raised. olmstead and her husband, bob, made the two-and-a-half-hour drive from their home in sacramento to attend two of the stanford women’s home meets during ledecky’s freshman season, standing in for her parents when they could not be there to cheer for her.  the pro swim series meet here was the first time olmstead had seen ledecky compete in an olympic 50-meter course. they arrived at the same time at the center that olmstead helped build — she was one of haines’s first star athletes at the santa clara swim club — and greeted each other warmly in the foyer. a few black-and-white portraits are on prominent display there, including one from the 1960s of olmstead posed sitting on a starting block in street clothes, gazing over her right shoulder.  “wow,” ledecky said. “look at the hair flip.”  ledecky mentioned that she had watched a youtube clip of olmstead racing in the 250-yard freestyle at the nationals in 1960 without, as was custom then, the aid of a cap, goggles or flip turns. olmstead asked what she thought of her stroke. “it was really good,” ledecky said. “i was impressed.”            image        ledecky and olmstead hugging goodbye after the pro swim series.   credit  preston gannaway for the new york times         olmstead asked about school, and ledecky spoke enthusiastically about a psychology course she had taken, “how beliefs create reality.” one day the student reluctantly became the teacher when ledecky was asked to talk about how she had used goal-setting and mental imagery to win her gold medals.        olmstead remembered being stared at by students who recognized her as an olympic swimmer and getting asked out for coffee by boys. “it was a bit intrusive because i didn’t know them,” olmstead said, adding, “i remember being self-conscious.”  ledecky could relate to being stared at and said she had also been approached by other students after arriving on campus shortly after the olympics. “i actually really enjoyed that,” she said. “i wanted to meet as many new people as i could.”  but she said the curiosity about her had quickly died down. “i feel like just another student on campus,” she said.  olmstead nodded and said, “you were a little more mature than i was.”  after ledecky was done racing in the 1,500 meters, she and olmstead resumed comparing notes.  olmstead’s husband stood off to the side, just within earshot, shaking his head.  “chris started watching katie, and she started getting really excited about the meets in a way that she’d never been before,” he said. “i think she is seeing herself the way she would have swum if she could have kept going.”       ',\n",
       " 'the russian figure skater yulia lipnitskaya retired at 19 after a battle with anorexia. lipnitskaya’s mother, daniela, told russia’s tass news agency monday that her daughter informed russian skating officials of her retirement in april after three months of treatment for the disorder.  lipnitskaya won gold in the team event at the 2014 winter olympics in sochi, russia, when she was 15, becoming the youngest olympic skating champion since 1936. however, she won no medals in the individual competition, where she had been considered a potential champion.  lipnitskaya bounced back with silver at the world championships in april 2014, her last major event.  she became a symbol of the sochi olympics for many russians, especially after president vladimir v. putin praised her performances. but she struggled to cope with fame. she complained in november 2014 that she had lost her freedom and felt “constant stress” when trying to live up to her fans’ expectations.        football  bengals linebacker suspended five games  cincinnati bengals linebacker vontaze burfict missed the first three games last season because of his hit to antonio brown’s head in the playoffs. he will miss the first five this season thanks to another rattling hit, this time in a preseason game. the n.f.l. has suspended burfict, the bengals’ defensive leader, for leveling chiefs running back anthony sherman in violation of its player safety rules, the latest in burfict’s history of egregious hits that have drawn fines and suspensions.    stafford agrees to extension  quarterback matthew stafford agreed to a five-year contract extension with the detroit lions. stafford was entering the last season of his $53 million, three-year contract. he stood to get quite a raise and perhaps a deal richer than the $125 million, five-year contract the oakland raiders gave derek carr this summer. he helped the lions reach the playoffs last season for the third time in six seasons.   jets name mccown the starter  josh mccown will start at quarterback in the jets’ regular-season opener at buffalo, beating out christian hackenberg and bryce petty. coach todd bowles announced his decision, ending a strange training-camp competition.            image     competition in the 10th annual world gravy wrestling championships at a pub near bacup, england.   credit  oli scarff/agence france-presse &mdash; getty images         mccown, 38, was the assumed starter the moment he signed a one-year, $6 million deal in march, and that never changed despite the fact he has played in just one series in a preseason game. hackenberg, a second-round pick last year, had an increase in practice snaps and had started the last two games. but he struggled mightily and made no real push to win the job. petty was considered the third option, and was solid in the preseason but left saturday’s game against the giants with a sprained knee.         giants defensive end barred four games  the giants backup defensive end owa odighizuwa has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the regular season for violating the n.f.l.’s policy on performance-enhancing substances. also, with his fellow defensive tackle jay bromley suddenly nursing an injured left knee, dalvin tomlinson, a second-round draft pick out of alabama, will probably line up beside damon harrison in the season opener in dallas on sept. 9.   broncos lose lynch to sprained shoulder  just one week after calling off their five-month competition, the denver broncos may have to carry three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster after losing the backup paxton lynch for several weeks to a sprained right (throwing) shoulder sustained in denver’s 20-17 preseason win over green bay on saturday night.   depleted bills sign a quarterback  the buffalo bills signed keith wenning to address their injury-depleted quarterback position entering their final preseason game. buffalo turned to wenning because the starter, tyrod taylor, and the third-stringer, t. j. yates are being evaluated for concussions sustained saturday in a 13-9 preseason loss at baltimore.  baseball  scherzer, in return, stops the marlins  max scherzer overpowered giancarlo stanton, howie kendrick hit a three-run triple and the nationals beat the miami marlins, 11-2, in washington. scherzer (13-5) allowed one run and five hits and had 10 strikeouts in his return from the 10-day disabled list. jayson werth had a two-run homer off jose urena (12-6) in his first game with the nationals since he sustained a left foot contusion june 5.   jones stars as orioles win fifth straight  adam jones hit a milestone home run, welington castillo had three hits and two r.b.i., and the orioles beat the seattle mariners, 7-6, in baltimore for their fifth straight victory. jones’s solo home run in the fifth gave him 25 for a team-record seventh consecutive season.   red sox end four-game skid  christian vazquez had four hits, including a two-run homer, eduardo nunez added a solo shot and the boston red sox beat the blue jays, 6-5, in toronto, snapping a four-game skid.  hockey  ratelle’s and lindros’s jerseys to be retired  the rangers will retire jean ratelle’s no. 19 and the philadelphia flyers will retire eric lindros’s no. 88 this season. the rangers will raise ratelle’s number to the rafters before their feb. 25 game against the detroit red wings, and the flyers will honor lindros before their jan. 18 game against the toronto maple leafs.  ratelle played parts of 16 seasons with the rangers and is second on their franchise goals list with 336 and third in assists with 481 and points with 817. lindros, who won the hart trophy as most valuable player in 1995, was inducted into the hockey hall of fame last year.

       " 'madrid — viktor kassai was probably still walking off the field at the santiago bernabeu when someone, somewhere, decided it was time to update his spanish-language wikipedia page.  at the end of a brief list of the highlights of what has been a long, distinguished refereeing career — his appointments in european championships and world cups, his distinctions in officiating olympic and  champions league final s — kassai’s electronic assailant decided a postscript was needed.  “he was also appointed to the quarterfinal of the champions league between real madrid and bayern munich,” it read, before describing kassai as real’s “best player” and the “game’s mvp.”  “at the end of the game, florentino perez, the president of the madrid team, awarded him a diamond pin, the greatest honor the club offers to referees who help them in big games,” the passage concluded. there followed a brief, bitter explanation for the malicious edit. “and that is how i lost my bet.”        it is a shame indeed that, at the end of one of the most absorbing games in recent champions league history — won by real, 4-2, after extra time — the performance of the referee should attract such attention.  in an ideal world, it would warrant no mention whatsoever. kassai would be afforded the anonymity that in his chosen profession indicates excellence. the focus would instead rest solely on those players who had produced a game of the very highest quality, two hours of grueling, enthralling, breathless entertainment between two of soccer’s true heavyweights.  all of the questions directed at zinedine zidane, the victorious real madrid coach, in the immediate aftermath would have been about the brilliant ruthlessness of cristiano ronaldo, whose hat trick eventually finished off bayern; about the energy of marcelo, real’s unstinting fullback; about the poise and panache of toni kroos.  zidane would have been asked about real’s seventh straight visit to the semifinals in this competition, about the chances of the club that lionizes the champions league more than any other would become the first to retain it since its reinvention in 1992.  his counterpart, carlo ancelotti, meanwhile, would have been given the chance to pay tribute to his bayern team’s refusal to be beaten, and forced to consider whether this defeat represented something close to the end of an era. philipp lahm, his captain, will never play in the champions league again; neither will xabi alonso, one of the finest players of his generation. both have said that they will retire this summer. the likes of franck ribéry and arjen robben will, sadly, not be too far behind.        kassai, though, obscured all of that tuesday, denied the game the epilogue it deserved. with one exception, all of the questions ancelotti faced were about the performance of the hungarian referee. ancelotti is a good-humored man, not given to unnecessary exaggeration. when asked if he had spoken to kassai after the game, if he had made his unhappiness known, he simply cocked an eyebrow. “i told him ‘good job,’” he said.  his fury, though, was evident. the red card that saw bayern deprived of arturo vidal for extra time — arguably the game’s pivotal moment — was not “a foul,” ancelotti said. two of ronaldo’s three goals were offside, he said.  he might have added that robert lewandowski lost a clear run at goal when he was adjudged, incorrectly, to be offside; that casemiro, the real madrid midfielder, might have been sent off long before vidal was. it was no surprise that ancelotti declined to mention that bayern’s first goal, a penalty, was, at best, debatable, or to expand on zidane’s claim that bayern’s second goal stemmed from another offside.  he did not need to, though, to prove his point that “the decisions penalized bayern a lot.”  “in a quarterfinal, there has to be a referee with more quality,” he said. “they are trying, but it is the moment to bring in video referees. there are too many errors. in some decisions, there is a lot of doubt, but there was no doubt here. you did not need to see a video to see that vidal got the ball. i saw it straightaway.”  he was not the only one simmering with anger. karl-heinz rummenigge, bayern’s chief executive, said kassai had left the german champions “distraught.” claudio bravo, the manchester city goalkeeper and an international teammate of vidal’s, pointed out that — although there were six officials on the field, per uefa’s regulations — they all appeared to be “blind.”          such criticism — in general — is the last thing the referees deserve. soccer gets quicker every year; the players are faster, stronger, and the rules ever more intricate; as robben demonstrated amply here, there are plenty out there committed to hoodwinking them, too.        and yet this level of controversy is unsustainable. after barcelona’s miraculous comeback against paris saint-germain in this tournament last month, p.s.g.  sent a dossier  to uefa, which runs the tournament, detailing its grievances about the referee’s performance in that game. now another high-profile fixture has been stained by the same problem, and the same complaints.  as ancelotti acknowledged, video referees will be a reality in the near future; experiments have already taken place to see if they can be used effectively to adjudicate on penalty decisions. that, though, has to be merely the start; a more comprehensive system is required if there is to be any hope of these situations being avoided in the future.  europe’s referees themselves would, doubtless, welcome such a development. kassai included. in december, in the club world cup, he became the first official in history to award a penalty  after consulting a video replay . his wikipedia page would still be accurate if only he had been given the chance to use that same technology here.

       "['the summer olympics won’t arrive in los angeles for another nine years, but its local organizing committee will begin selling olympic advertising as soon as 2021.  the organizing committee, l.a. 2028, and the olympic television partner nbcuniversal are announcing a comprehensive partnership to sell advertising and sponsorships for all olympic and paralympic games from 2021 through 2028.  traditionally, advertisers interested in the olympics have had to approach a number of different sellers. they went to nbc, which will televise the olympics through 2032, to purchase television advertising before, during and after the games. they went to the united states olympic committee to sponsor team u.s.a. they went to the local organizing committee for marketing efforts at the games themselves.  now they will go to nbcuniversal, which will lead the partnership, for all of it, giving the international olympic committee’s largest media partner uncommon power over the marketing of the olympics in the united states.        “what we are responding to here is not what the marketplace needs, but is demanding,” casey wasserman, chairman of l.a. 2028, said in an interview.  linda yaccarino, the chairman of advertising at nbcuniversal, said advertisers would be able to purchase the rights to intellectual property, product marketing and to opportunities to market their companies at the games through the partnership, in addition to buying traditional television and digital streaming advertising.  l.a. 2028 and the u.s.o.c. had previously formed a joint venture to control united states-related olympic and paralympic sponsorship rights for the same time period, 2021 through 2028. according to wasserman, l.a. 2028 has given the u.s.o.c. a $480 million guarantee for those rights. details of how nbcuniversal, the u.s.o.c. and l.a. 2028 will divide revenues were not released.  the international olympic committee mandates local organizing committees reach a commercial agreement for the games with their national olympic committee to avoid confusion. but the i.o.c. doesn’t stipulate what that agreement looks like, and the one between l.a. 2028 and the u.s.o.c. is particularly long.  the eight-year joint venture is three years longer than the five-year partnership between the local organizing committee and the u.s.o.c. ahead of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta. the length is intentional, to facilitate selling to sponsors who want to be involved for more than one olympics cycle.        “in the world of sports, long-term sponsor deals are the norm,” said wasserman, pointing to television rights agreements and title sponsorships that extend for 10 or 20 years.  l.a. 2028 is targeting $2.5 billion in total sponsorship revenue for the games, wasserman said.  nbcuniversal made a “significant financial commitment” to l.a. 2028 as part of the agreement, but declined to reveal the amount.

       "['the summer olympics won’t arrive in los angeles for another nine years, but its local organizing committee will begin selling olympic advertising as soon as 2021.  the organizing committee, l.a. 2028, and the olympic television partner nbcuniversal are announcing a comprehensive partnership to sell advertising and sponsorships for all olympic and paralympic games from 2021 through 2028.  traditionally, advertisers interested in the olympics have had to approach a number of different sellers. they went to nbc, which will televise the olympics through 2032, to purchase television advertising before, during and after the games. they went to the united states olympic committee to sponsor team u.s.a. they went to the local organizing committee for marketing efforts at the games themselves.  now they will go to nbcuniversal, which will lead the partnership, for all of it, giving the international olympic committee’s largest media partner uncommon power over the marketing of the olympics in the united states.        “what we are responding to here is not what the marketplace needs, but is demanding,” casey wasserman, chairman of l.a. 2028, said in an interview.  linda yaccarino, the chairman of advertising at nbcuniversal, said advertisers would be able to purchase the rights to intellectual property, product marketing and to opportunities to market their companies at the games through the partnership, in addition to buying traditional television and digital streaming advertising.  l.a. 2028 and the u.s.o.c. had previously formed a joint venture to control united states-related olympic and paralympic sponsorship rights for the same time period, 2021 through 2028. according to wasserman, l.a. 2028 has given the u.s.o.c. a $480 million guarantee for those rights. details of how nbcuniversal, the u.s.o.c. and l.a. 2028 will divide revenues were not released.  the international olympic committee mandates local organizing committees reach a commercial agreement for the games with their national olympic committee to avoid confusion. but the i.o.c. doesn’t stipulate what that agreement looks like, and the one between l.a. 2028 and the u.s.o.c. is particularly long.  the eight-year joint venture is three years longer than the five-year partnership between the local organizing committee and the u.s.o.c. ahead of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta. the length is intentional, to facilitate selling to sponsors who want to be involved for more than one olympics cycle.        “in the world of sports, long-term sponsor deals are the norm,” said wasserman, pointing to television rights agreements and title sponsorships that extend for 10 or 20 years.  l.a. 2028 is targeting $2.5 billion in total sponsorship revenue for the games, wasserman said.  nbcuniversal made a “significant financial commitment” to l.a. 2028 as part of the agreement, but declined to reveal the amount.

       "['calgary, alberta — hobbled by a reputation for gross expense and corruption, the international olympic committee has become a mendicant, shuffling from nation to nation, shaking its cup and asking if anyone might be interested in bidding on the 2026 winter games.  norway, the greatest of all winter olympic countries, found too many expenses and too much potential environmental damage. pass. in innsbruck, austria, which hosted the 1976 winter games, the burghers shook their heads and voted no. a canton in switzerland, home of the i.o.c., voted to bolt the door.  so olympic officials turned their eyes to calgary, the lively canadian city that hosted the 1988 winter games. they murmured softly and smiled sweetly and asked: might you like to bid?  calgary officials nodded, yes, they might like that indeed. and the i.o.c. officials, well-heeled princelings beneath their tattered robes, smiled so broad.        this is a city brimming with optimism. mayor naheed nenshi is a quick-witted urban wonk, and the city has a diverse and educated population. its most recent public work is a breathtakingly beautiful public library that arrived on time and under budget. hizzoner walked into a debate last week and a later interview with me intent on selling all on his vision ahead of a referendum tuesday on whether to submit a bid.  “the international olympic committee does worry me and keep me up a bit at night,” nenshi said. “but this is an outstanding deal for calgary.”  nenshi and his supporters propound canadian exceptionalism: we would stage these games as we do everything, which is to say on budget and without corruption or toleration of doping.  you are tempted to root even as you wince. so many optimistic cities and nations have walked this path only to tumble down the olympic stairs of inflated hopes, spiraling costs and corruptions’ bruises.            image     a cross-country skier at canmore, near calgary.   credit  todd korol for the new york times         quite a few in calgary share my skepticism. boosterish sorts admit to jumping nerves before tuesday’s referendum.        the city is mired in an oil and gas slump, and 25 percent of its downtown towers are vacant. a survey group hired by the city surveyed more than 7,000 people and found decidedly more with a negative view of the olympic bid. of late, a councilor who was allied with the mayor in pushing the olympics announced that he could no longer support a bid.  “there are too many unanswered questions and an incredible amount of risk,” the councilor, evan woolley, said at a public debate on the plebiscite.   [want more canadian coverage in your inbox? subscribe to our weekly    canada letter newsletter.   ]   no olympic games since 1968 has met its budget. vancouver went a modest 13 percent over (although its athletes’ village went belly up afterward at a cost of $100 million), while other cities had grand mal seizures. london and sochi  ran over by 76 percent and 280 percent.   when tokyo signed on for the 2020 summer games, officials sounded remarkably like those in calgary. they promised to deliver a frugal penny- and pound-wise olympics for about $7.3 billion.  then they adjusted estimates to $12 billion. of late,  the number has soared to $25 to $30 billion.   oops.  the salt lake city games in 2002 nearly drowned in a despond of corruption; the  pyeongchang games in february chewed up forests and pushed out villagers .        i attended the 2016 summer games in rio de janeiro and  wrote of the corruption and violence  that had fallen on the poorest in the beautiful city, and the schools and hospitals starved for funds as the government spent grandly on its olympic taj mahal.            image        snow makers covering canada olympic park in calgary with a blanket of new snow. presumably the real stuff would be available at a 2026 olympic winter games.   credit  todd korol for the new york times         rio’s mayor at the time, eduardo paes, wrote a letter complaining of my calumnies and took offense at talk of corruption. another year passed, and brazilian prosecutors found olympic corruption everywhere. an executive from a big construction firm testified that he had given $5 million in bribes to paes.  the former mayor denies those charges.   calgary hired ernst &amp; young to crunch its numbers. i sat in a council meeting as its sober gentlemen took us skipping through the numbers, all of which — miracle! — added up in favor of the bid.  i nosed about afterward on the internet and noticed that ernst &amp; young had served as a richly compensated “exclusive provider” to the rio olympics. previous olympic cities, ernst &amp; young noted in a news release, had seen arenas turn into white elephants. not rio, no no. “we have established sustainable postgame use for facilities” through a regimen of good governance and finance, the release said.  two years later, rio de janeiro is stuck with a rumbling herd of white elephants, olympic pools filled with rat feces, and a burned and collapsed velodrome and wrecked arenas. officials have scrapped promises to turn olympic handball courts into four public schools. as espn reported, the only one of the sports federations not found implicated in corruption was the brazilian confederation of sports for the visually impaired.  you can only hope that olympic and perhaps ernst &amp; young officials had some fitful nights of sleep.  the i.o.c. has grown edgy at the lack of suitors seeking to host games and proclaimed itself ready to shed the tux and don the hair shirt. it introduced a “games changer” called the  new norm , which encourages construction of fewer new stadiums and would share more dollars with host cities.        so calgary would, for the most part, refurbish facilities used in the 1988 olympics and focus construction on a much-desired new winter field house. the i.o.c.’s case is not vaporous, and city officials have debated it publicly.  a snow-capped wall of rockies rises to the city’s west, and the region is rich in winter sports, because of the legacy of hosting the 1988 games. to drive to canmore, a ski town that sits within the ice-blue shadow of those mountains and would host olympic events, is to find world-class winter athletes on nearly every block.  that said, calgary officials take a parochial, calgary-centric view of costs, the details of which were still being worked on in the days before the vote. mayor nenshi said calgary’s share would come in at a touch more than $400 million. the provincial alberta government would fork over $700 million, and the federal government in ottawa has promised a barrel of money, too.            image        the olympic flag flying with the flags of world countries at canada olympic park in calgary.   credit  todd korol for the new york times         “this is almost a tax rebate,” the mayor said.  this would be so if we assumed tax dollars not gathered in calgary fell from the sky like snow. alberta is hard-pressed by the same slump in oil revenue, and money spent renovating curling and skating rinks could mean less money to build and repair schools, roads and parks.  more broadly, calgary officials speak of the olympics as a defibrillator for local spirits grown gloomy. the games offer two weeks of free global advertising.  david finch, a professor specializing in marketing, participated in that recent debate and wove a splendid web. “we’ve got 30 years of data that shows they will come,” he said. “it is the equivalent of hosting 21 super bowls.”        this is debate as a p. t. barnum marketing seminar. i called brad humphreys, an economics professor at west virginia university who studies olympic finances. he acknowledged that the olympics make you feel good, and it’s a two-week advertisement.  the remainder is a busted model.  “there is a lot of temporary employment and no evidence of substantial economic impact,” humphreys said. “the very fact the i.o.c. is desperate to force cities to compete to host the games is to extract as much benefit as they can for themselves.”  mayor nenshi acknowledges the olympics are no economic silver bullet. but he is convinced calgary can game the gamers.  “i believe calgary can host the cleanest, most cost-effective games in history,” he said. “if that’s not what they want, we’ll say, ‘thank you.’”  as i listened, a tale from dim memory jumped to mind. decades back, my wife and i were newly married, and we wandered in a fine mood through manhattan and came upon a game of three-card monte. we are city natives and knew the game was a flytrap for naïve tourists. but we watched, and by god, after a while we had it figured out.  i raised my hand and put down a $20 bill.  the three-card-monte curator waved me in and smiled so sweetly and set to moving his cards a little faster and a little better. i guessed wrong. damn. we were church-mouse poor, and i needed that $20. so i put down another bill. my stupidity ended at 60 unaffordable dollars.  here’s my advice to calgary: keep an eye on those i.o.c. cardsharps. i guarantee the cards will end up moving faster than you guess.
